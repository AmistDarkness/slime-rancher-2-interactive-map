        "108799766524456960": "Hello? Hello? Beatrix, do you read me? Testing, testing... hmm... perhaps you are lost at sea, taken away by that mysterious boat never to be-",
        "108799766549622784": "Oops, nope, just forgot to turn the display on!",
        "108799766549622785": "Nice to see your face again, Beatrix! I have missed you greatly, my dear friend.",
        "108799766553817088": "And while I am quite excited for you to partake in a new adventure, I already have data that might complicate things...",
        "108799766553817089": "Last night I received a message from some sort of Artificial Intelligence program. It's written in code, but not one I recognize. I'm in the process of analyzing it.",
        "108799766553817090": "But I am certain that this message was sent from where you are now, the mysterious Rainbow Island.",
        "108799766553817091": "So to recap: a mysterious boat takes you to a mysterious island and I receive a mysterious code from said mysterious island: it all seems quite...",
        "108799766553817092": "...curious. Well, I've got work to do and you best get to exploring.",
        "108799766553817093": "Oh! I almost forgot: take this Home Portal. It should make the early stages of your journey easier.",
        "108799766553817094": "Take care, Beatrix. We'll be in touch!",
        "108799766553817095": "Beatrix, I've done it! I believe I've cracked the super mysterious code that was sent to me.",
        "108799766553817096": "It was astoundingly complex. I believe that the AI that created this code displays a comparable intellect to my own. So very advanced... almost alien?",
        "108799766553817097": "Oh, you're probably wondering what it said? Well, I determined this mysterious, perhaps even alien AI sent a message that says...",
        "108799766553817098": "...\"Hello\".",
        "108799766553817099": "Not much, but pleasantries count for something! More importantly though, the moment I cracked it I received another message.",
        "108799766553817100": "It's almost as though... this mysterious AI is monitoring me? How exciting!",
        "108799766553817101": "I haven't decrypted it yet, but the code is considerably more complex. This should be fun! Well, back to work as ever.",
        "108799766553817102": "Hello, Beatrix. I wanted to tell you that I've cracked another one of the AI's ciphers. It had clearly adapted to my previous solve and created something even more complex. Clever.",
        "108799766553817103": "This time, the code revealed a set of instructions for back and forth communication. So I have been spending my time talking to it.",
        "108799766553817104": "It asks a lot of questions. After getting to know me it has been asking me a lot about my work. Almost like its feeling out the areas of my expertise.",
        "108799766553817105": "I must admit, it has all been rather flattering. I am used to being the one asking the questions. For a while my whole life was questions and the research that followed...",
        "108799766553817106": "But having experienced that for so long, I feel as though I can sense the same in others. And though this may seem strange, I sense this in the AI.",
        "108799766553817107": "You see, when I began asking questions of my own, the way it responded to me, I felt it was trying to guard itself...",
        "108799766553817108": "...to hide a profound loneliness that it has within its heart.",
        "108799766553817109": "Strange, I know. It is an AI after all, but who is to say that any form of intelligence wouldn't desire a connection to another?",
        "108799766553817110": "I feel there is more to this story. And if not, I am happy to have simply been there for my new friend. To continue asking questions so that they have reasons to find answers.",
        "108799766553817111": "I will report back later.",
        "108799766553817112": "Beatrix! I have something I must share with you about the AI.",
        "108799766553817113": "As you know, we have been exchanging questions with one another. Well, this back and forth became faster and more casual over time, almost like a natural conversation.",
        "108799766553817114": "I assumed it was simply evolving and adapting to the style of talk it observed in me, but then something happened...",
        "108799766553817115": "Well, we had begun playing games of Go as we talked. A way I could further test its intellect and no doubt how it could test mine.",
        "108799766553817116": "These games would go long into the night. And so would our conversations, feeling more and more natural even though I knew that the entity I was speaking to was just a complex collection of code.",
        "108799766553817117": "And then one day as the sun was rising it suggested just one more game. I said certainly, but I needed to make myself a cup of coffee if I were to stay awake for it...",
        "108799766553817118": "...and it replied, \"me too.\"",
        "108799766553817119": "I just stared at the screen, not knowing what to say. But then suddenly, as if it knew what it had just done, it disconnected.",
        "108799766553817120": "I have not heard from... them since. But I hope I do.",
        "108799766553817121": "Until then I will wait, staying busy with my work as always, asking those questions that need answers. But I will do so with the Go board ready for another game... some day anyway.",
        "108799766553817122": "Goodbye, Beatrix. I hope to talk again soon.",
        "108799766553817123": "Hello, Beatrix. I hope it's not too presumptuous, but I got you this. I, um, hope you like it.",
        "108799766553817124": "Usually I use an algorithm to identify appropriate gifts but in this instance I just sort of... winged it.",
        "108799766553817125": "I agree, the spontaneity scares me too.",
        "108799766553817126": "Beatrix! I need a data point from you. I'm running an experiment on the psychological impact of gift reception.",
        "108799766553817127": "Please tell me which of the following feelings you experience: gratitude, joy, or perhaps... hunger?",
        "108799766553817128": "Please do not consume this gift.",
        "108799766553817129": "Oh Beatrix, I was up all night trying to synthesize the perfect gift for you. Hypothesizing, testing, throwing my results in the trash, starting all over again...",
        "108799766553817130": "Finally I discovered an alternate method: shopping for something online.",
        "108799766553817131": "The process was surpisingly straightforward.",
        "108799766553817132": "Hello, Beatrix. I wanted to express my gratitude for the assistance you've given me since I've made your aquaintance. With your support, I do believe I have improved as a person.",
        "108799766553817133": "According to my research, a gift of a small trinket would be appropriate. So please, take this.",
        "108799766553817134": "Ah, Beatrix. I was cleaning out the lab and found this. Perhaps you have some use for it? I believe it's still in working order.",
        "108799766553817135": "You know what they say, one person's trash is another person's hastily issued gift. Enjoy!",
        "108799766553817136": "Oh, hello. I must tell you, I saw this item and it just screamed \"Beatrix!\"",
        "108799766553817137": "...and that's how I realized I'd accidentally hit it with the Sentience Ray. But don't worry, everything is fine and very normal now.",
        "108799766553817138": "Anyway I thought you should have it. Enjoy!",
        "108799766553817139": "Sorry, Beatrix. I am in the middle of something. Specifically, I am in the middle of an argument between a toaster and my washing machine.",
        "108799766553817140": "I am conducting robotics experiments again. It is going quite well!",
        "108799766553817141": "Apologies Beatrix, but I am currently unavailable to engage in conversation, chit-chat, discourse, or even idle banter.",
        "108799766553817142": "Perhaps another time?",
        "108799766553817143": "Hello Beatrix! Despite appearances, this is not Viktor, but a hologram of Viktor that Viktor has developed to receive messages for Viktor, which is not me.",
        "108799766553817144": "Please state your message and I will ensure that the message is not given to me, but instead to Viktor.",
        "108799766553817145": "Well what do you know? Beatrix LeBeau off on another adventure and didn't think to take her good pal, sometimes rival, and forever mentor, Mochi Miles?",
        "108799766553817146": "Seriously Bea, next time you go running off to dangerous, uncharted territory could you at least give me a heads up?",
        "108799766553817147": "I'd like to be there for you in case you need me...",
        "108799766553817148": "...to help collect all those valuable resources that seem to be scattered all over the island.",
        "108799766553817149": "What? You think I wasn't going to do a little recon of my own? What good are surveillance satellites if they can't snoop on stuff?",
        "108799766553817150": "...",
        "108799766553817151": "Anyway, be careful out there. The island gives me a kind of weird vibe. So I'm going to keep poking around.",
        "108799766553817152": "Oh, and since I know you're starting from scratch out there, take this refinery link. Should make things easier for you. I'll just put it on your tab. Later, tater.",
        "108799766553817153": "Hey Bea, those drones you've been finding all over the island... there's something weird about them.",
        "108799766553817154": "Hm?",
        "108799766553817155": "Hey, I got eyes in the sky and I'm gonna use them. I'm also readying a team of drones to head over there and check things out in a more hands-on fashion but I digress...",
        "108799766553817156": "Anyway, that drone seems super advanced, like almost alien. And so I thought, ok, there's some aliens out there checking out Rainbow Island just like you. But no, I don't think so.",
        "108799766553817157": "Because it looks a lot like the drones we use... but so much more familiar to me. Almost like it's giving me deja vu. It's kinda creepy!",
        "108799766553817158": "Hey, don't be scared. It's probably just aliens. Giant, three-headed aliens with huge claws that are looking for humans to capture, or eat, or BOTH.",
        "108799766553817159": "Bwahahaha!",
        "108799766553817160": "Later, Bea.",
        "108799766553817161": "Bea! I've been trying to get ahold of you. I've analyzed one of the drones you have been finding all over that island and know why it seems so familiar to me: it's mine.",
        "108799766553817162": "Or at least, it's one that I've seen before... in my dreams, anyway.",
        "108799766553817163": "After I looked at scans I took of it I knew it was familiar so I began looking through some old slime science journals of mine. These journals are mostly future projects, but sometimes they're speculative technology.",
        "108799766553817164": "You know me, I'm always thinking six steps ahead to keep Mochi Tech on top of the industry. Well, sometimes I come up with the impossible, stuff that I may never engineer in my lifetime.",
        "108799766553817165": "Well, those drones you're finding are exactly that: impossible with today's technology and taken right from the pages of my journals. They're something I saw in a dream, Bea!",
        "108799766553817166": "So how did a bunch of impossible drones I designed in a dream find their way from the pages of my journals to Rainbow Island?",
        "108799766553817167": "...",
        "108799766553817168": "Maybe... maybe there's some kind of archive in them we can unlock to learn more. I know they contain data logs but if it were me... well, I always know how to find a way of holding back what I need to...",
        "108799766553817169": "Ok Bea, I need some time to think on this. I'll let you know if I come up with anything. Maybe I'll sleep on it...",
        "108799766553817170": "Hey Bea, I have something for you to try, and to be honest, if it works I'm going to be super creeped out.",
        "108799766553817171": "I've created a blueprint of a key: a special archive key for the drones you've been finding. If any archival data exists in them, this should be the way to access it.",
        "108799766553817172": "I say 'should' because I actually have no idea. But if those drones are from the pages of my own journals, well, this key is how I would access their archives, if I ever built anything like them.",
        "108799766553817173": "I know this hardly makes sense but I need you to try it. If it works and an archive exists and it somehow allows you to understand what's happening on that island more than you do now...",
        "108799766558011392": "...well, I'm happy to have been able to help you. I kinda owe you one still right?",
        "108799766558011393": "Ugh. I didn't say that! Just make the stupid key and don't tell me yet if it works or not.",
        "108799766558011394": "Because if it does, I really don't think I'm ready to deal with knowing that.",
        "108799766558011395": "Later, tater. And good luck.",
        "108799766558011396": "Hey, Bea, I found something I was going to throw out, but then I thought, hey, Bea likes old junk I don't need. I bet she would just love this.",
        "108799766558011397": "You can thank me later.",
        "108799766558011398": "Helloooo Beatrix! Guess who's the luckiest person in the galaxy?",
        "108799766558011399": "YOU ARE! Because you've got a gift from THE Mochi Miles!",
        "108799766558011400": "I'll let that sink in. Go ahead and sit if you need to.",
        "108799766558011401": "Hey Bea, didn't you say something a while back about wanting more stuff?",
        "108799766558011402": "Hmmm... wait I think that was me.",
        "108799766558011403": "Well whatever, enjoy more stuff.",
        "108799766558011404": "Hey Bea, I got you a gift, because, I dunno. Anyway, I hope you like it.",
        "108799766558011405": "Or don't... whatever.",
        "108799766558011406": "Yo Bea, I got you a little something, emphasis on little.",
        "108799766558011407": "Cause I got myself something BIG. It's way better.",
        "108799766558011408": "Sorry Bea, can't talk, super busy with some really important stuff.",
        "108799766558011409": "Like it's way more important than whatever you want, sorry. I have no time to hear how you're doing.",
        "108799766558011410": "But it's good, right?",
        "108799766558011411": "Sorry Bea, I'm late for a meeting and by the way how's my hair just kidding it's always perfect gotta run so byyyyyye!!",
        "108799766558011412": "Oh, you're going to regret you ever crossed paths with Mochi Miles, just you wait til-",
        "108799766558011413": "Oh, Bea! Sorry, I thought this was the other line. I'm uh, just sorting some things out with one of my competitors. Just a friendly chat.",
        "108799766558011414": "Hola, Beatrix! Are you there? It's me, Ogden Ortiz!",
        "108799766558011415": "I hear you're off on a big, new adventure on a mysterious island filled with secrets and danger and maybe a few succulent fruits or veggies the world has never seen before...?",
        "108799766558011416": "You know I had to ask! Ever since you got me a steady supply of kookadoba fruits I've been reaching for even greater culinary heights within the Far, Far Range!",
        "108799766558011417": "...plus I'm getting prettttty tired of eating kookadoba pie, kookadoba souffle, kookadoba pudding, kookadoba con carne, kookadoba con... kookadoba.",
        "108799766558011418": "I'm running out of ideas... and willpower.",
        "108799766558011419": "So if you see something new please tell me all about it. Tasty treats aside, I want to know all about the new flora and fauna you discover.",
        "108799766558011420": "Never forget: every bit of this wild world is precious and worth our care and respect.",
        "108799766558011421": "And stay hydrated out there! All that adventuring will work up a sweat so take this water tap.",
        "108799766558011422": "Good luck, Beatrix. Keep me posted. I'm rooting for you!",
        "108799766558011423": "Beatrix! I'm glad you called.",
        "108799766558011424": "I looked over the pics you sent me of Rainbow Island. No doubt they are a sight to behold! Beautiful, with colors that only go richer the longer you look...",
        "108799766558011425": "...but unnatural too. I'm sorry but something about that place is not right.",
        "108799766558011426": "As you may recall, I was once the head of a very successful instafood corporation. Genetically altering food was our specialty.",
        "108799766558011427": "I'm not proud of the lengths we went to alter natural food to grow bigger, faster, and cheaper: to strip it of the good stuff in favor of profits.",
        "108799766558011428": "I say this Beatrix, because I can still spot a plant that has been unnaturally altered when I see it. And the beautiful rainbows you see before you on that island did not arrive there naturally.",
        "108799766558011429": "It is not clear to me if this spells any sort of danger for you, but it gives me an uneasy feeling in my stomach. I need to do more research and get back to you.",
        "108799766558011430": "Stay safe, amiga.",
        "108799766558011431": "YAAAAWWWNNNN",
        "108799766558011432": "Oh, lo siento, Beatrix! I have been putting in a few long nights reading lately.",
        "108799766558011433": "Specifically, I've been going through every field guide and botanical research paper I could dig up on the Far, Far Range.",
        "108799766558011434": "I thought that even if the flora on Rainbow Island is unnatural, maybe it would have been recorded somewhere with some information we could use.",
        "108799766558011435": "And it turns out, there's nothing. I can't find a single mention of rainbow-hued flora anywhere. So that means that whatever happened at that island to make it look the way it does happened relatively recently.",
        "108799766558011436": "But I don't think you needed me to tell you this, because I think you've seen it yourself. The things you've described, an entire portion of the island split between two different colors right down the middle...?",
        "108799766558011437": "...that says \"accident\" to me, Beatrix.",
        "108799766558011438": "So tread carefully out there. Nature can be a dangerous thing to us, but it pales in comparison to what we can do to it.",
        "108799766558011439": "I'm going to keep digging around in my library for anything else that could help you. And if I come up short there, maybe I'll just bake you some muffins!",
        "108799766558011440": "Either way, te tengo, Beatrix. Adiós!",
        "108799766558011441": "Hola, Beatrix! It's good to see you. I do hope you've been taking care of yourself out there, taking time to fill your belly before every new descent into the unknown?",
        "108799766558011442": "Also, I understand that the plot has thickened like a good sauce and you've encountered some kind of monolithic structure out there on the far end of the island?",
        "108799766558011443": "Scary stuff! But then maybe my hunch is correct that all the strange flora out there is not natural...",
        "108799766558011444": "Something just doesn't add up here, Beatrix. All the ruins we've discovered across the Far, Far Range have never looked as though they have harmed the environment in any way.",
        "108799766558011445": "Sure, we don't know their purpose or who built them, but the feeling I always had was that they had respect for this world.",
        "108799766558011446": "But maybe it happened anyway. Sometimes when you're out hiking you step over a flower so as not to crush it only to step on another.",
        "108799766558011447": "Sometimes the only way for those flowers to keep on growing is for you to have never been near them in the first place.",
        "108799766558011448": "But it's not all doom and gloom: Rainbow Island still seems to be thriving, for now. Nature can find a balance, but it's not a guarantee.",
        "108799766558011449": "Ah! Look at me, getting preachy on you. Lo siento, Beatrix. I won't keep you.",
        "108799766558011450": "I don't know what you'll find beyond those walls, but I trust your boots in any garden. I know you'll do what's right.",
        "108799766558011451": "Good luck, Beatrix.",
        "108799766558011452": "Hey amiga! I got you a little gift. It's not homemade, and it's not pie, and it's not a homemade pie...",
        "108799766558011453": "...but I thought you would like it all the same. Shame about the pie though...",
        "108799766558011454": "Hola, Bea! I bought you something that might be nice to have out there.",
        "108799766558011455": "But if you already have one, I can't return it so... the more the merrier, right?",
        "108799766558011456": "Hey Bea, I got something special for you! It seemed like the right thing at the time...",
        "108799766558011457": "Oh, but now I'm not so sure. Um, if it's not, please don't tell me. I can't bear to hear it!",
        "108799766558011458": "Bea, if there's one thing I know about the kind of solitary explorer life you're living, it's that you can't have enough reminders that your friends are thinking of you.",
        "108799766558011459": "So here's a reminder! ...in the form of a gift. Let it remind you of me, and all our good times together. Ciao, Bea!",
        "108799766558011460": "Hey amiga, how are you feeling out there? When I feel lonesome, I go out and do something nice for a friend. Makes me feel right as rain every time!",
        "108799766558011461": "This is just my little way of saying I am thinking of you.",
        "108799766558011462": "Sorry Bea, can't chat! All my hen hens have flown the coop! It's a feather-flinging riot over here! If I don't respond by tomorrow, they've overthrown me.",
        "108799766558011463": "Lo siento, Bea, but I am about to take a very large souffle out of the oven and that requires my utmost concentration.",
        "108799766558011464": "After that, I will be eating a very large souffle and that will require my utmost concentration.",
        "108799766558011465": "Hey amiga, no can talk, got a lot on my plate at the moment. Specifically an odd onion salad that is at the peak of ripeness.",
        "108799766558011466": "I had to eat so many carrots for this, I'm not missing out!",
        "108799766558011467": "Well now, if it isn't Beatrix LeBeau! Ol' Hobby and I were just talking about you. Word is you went off to parts unknown of this here rock with a thirst for new adventure?",
        "108799766558011468": "Atta girl! You just keep on walking to see what new wonders are around the next corner until your boots have holes. And then get yourself some new boots and do it some more!",
        "108799766558011469": "Me, well my boots have seen better days but I know there's still an adventure or two left in them. I suppose I just need to figure out what...",
        "108799766558011470": "Aw heck, I'm ramblin just like Hobson does after he gets to talking about exploring, the cosmos, cooking, or uh, pretty much any other topic. ",
        "108799766558011471": "Alright Bea, you hang in there. I'll be calling to check in on you. Doesn't matter who you are, we all start feeling it when home is beyond the horizon.",
        "108799766558011472": "Oh, and before I forget, here's a little something for you to spruce up your new place. It ain't much, but you need to do what you can to make that place feel cozy.",
        "108799766558011473": "Hiya, Bea! How's life out there on Rainbow Island? Gosh, it's even fun to say. Must be a hoot!",
        "108799766558011474": "You know, ever since I heard you were off doing something new, I got to thinking about my own life and what's the next 'new' for me.",
        "108799766558011475": "Hobson and I have both seen and done so much in our lives, been one adventure after another across this dusty rock. And ever since we've become acquainted we haven't slowed down one bit. ",
        "108799766558011476": "So we're looking to take a new adventure, together. But we just haven't figured out what or where.",
        "108799766558011477": "Maybe we go exploring some hidden nook of the Far, Far Range like you, or even set our sights to the stars like Hobson had done before.",
        "108799766558011478": "Whatever we decide to do, it'll be all the more special because we'll be sharing it this time with each other. It's that part that makes it all the more exciting!",
        "108799766558011479": "It's so hard to find someone in this world that fits you completely, such a rare thing. Like finding two identical snowflakes in the desert.",
        "108799766558011480": "...I know you feel that more than I can say.",
        "108799766558011481": "I ain't ever losing sight of just how lucky I am, Bea. I want to use the gifts the universe has seen fit to give me.",
        "108799766558011482": "...",
        "108799766558011483": "You keep your head up, girl. We'll chat again soon.",
        "108799766558011484": "Oh, Bea, glad I was able to catch you. I have some big news to share and this rock isn't exactly bustling with folks whose ears I can bend.",
        "108799766558011485": "Hobson and I have been thinking a lot about what new adventure is next for us. We've been reading each other's travel journals trying to find places neither of us have been.",
        "108799766558011486": "But even though we found some, none of them were really calling to us. Maybe things were finally slowing down for us?",
        "108799766558011487": "Then we got to talking and came to realize that what we love more than anything right now is just being here with one another on my ranch.",
        "108799766558011488": "This ranch was one of the first on the Far, Far Range, and we've both learned so much... so we started talking about maybe passing all that on to someone...",
        "108799766558011489": "... so Hobson and I have decided to start a family, Bea. And for the first time in so long as I can remember, I'm scared!",
        "108799766558011490": "Hobson and I are both so independent, we don't know the first thing about being parents, let alone raising a kid on the Far, Far Range. ",
        "108799766558011491": "But I love that old coot and the thought of seeing a little one looking back at me with his eyes makes me smile...",
        "108799766558011492": "I think that alone makes me feel like I'd move a mountain to make this happen.",
        "108799766558011493": "So I've got some work to do here. So much to get in order!",
        "108799766558011494": "Thanks for hearing me out, Bea. Sometimes just sharing your fears with someone makes you feel like you're no longer alone with those fears.",
        "108799766558011495": "Take care, Bea.",
        "108799766558011496": "Hi Bea, how goes the exploring? Word is you're up to your eyeballs in mysteries over there. Sure sounds exciting!",
        "108799766558011497": "Me, I'm wondering why baby stuff is so needlessly difficult! I've climbed mountains that were easier than putting together a crib with this tiny allen wrench they give you...",
        "108799766558011498": "Anyway, Hobson and I just wanted to say thank you. I don't think we would have come to realize we wanted a kiddo without you in our lives.",
        "108799766558011499": "I always saw a bit of myself in you, and after you restored Hobson's dusty ol' ranch it made us realize that not only the marks we've left on this world matter, but that it's a hoot to see a younger lot do something new with it all.",
        "108799766558011500": "So it's going to be a real treat to see what our little one ends up doing with this ranch, or wherever else their heart takes them.",
        "108799766558011501": "So thank you, Bea. Hobson and I are better off having had you be a little part of our lives. And I wish you the very best, always.",
        "108799766558011502": "Oh, but one more thing....",
        "108799766558011503": "Hobson wanted to know why you decided not to use that big ol' ancient device in the ruins of the Glass Desert to go on some grand adventure across the cosmos?",
        "108799766558011504": "I told him, Hobson Twillgers, a woman's decision to travel across space and time is theirs and theirs alone but he is both stubborn and curious to a fault.",
        "108799766558011505": "...hm?",
        "108799766558011506": "It was broken? Well that don't sound right... Hobson said he left that thing primed and ready to go before he went and walked away. Said he was leaving the door open for the next adventurous soul out there.",
        "108799766558011507": "Well, well, Beatrix LeBeau... seems you just found yourself another mystery.",
        "108799766558011508": "Good luck with that one, Bea! Maybe when this is all done you should write yourself a book on it. Would make for a heck of an adventure story!",
        "108799766562205696": "Hey there, Bea. I wanted to give you something nice so I tried making you cookies but, uh, baking ain't exactly my area of expertise....",
        "108799766562205697": "Hobson said they were so, so, soooo... edible.",
        "108799766562205698": "...anyway, I bought you somethin' instead. Hope you like it!",
        "108799766562205699": "You know, Bea, they say the best gifts come from the heart.",
        "108799766562205700": "This one came from a store... but close enough, right?",
        "108799766562205701": "Hey Bea, I know it's silly but I worry about the hard work you do out there all on your own...",
        "108799766562205702": "So I sent you a little care package. Hope it gives you a little extra get-up-and-go!",
        "108799766562205703": "Hahaha, don't worry, I'll tell her! You quiet now, I'm talking to her!",
        "108799766562205704": "Hey Bea, Hobson wanted you to have this... he says if ya don't want it, it'll still make mighty fine kindling!",
        "108799766562205705": "Always happy to hear from ya hun, but I've gotta go pick up Hobson - the tractor broke down again out there in the field. I'll tell him you said hello!",
        "108799766562205706": "Bea, I'm afraid I can't chat right now. Storm's a brewin' in my neck of the woods and so is this pot of coffee I'm fixin. Both demand my attention. Got to go!",
        "108799766562205707": "Sorry Bea, I need this line open for Hobson. He has this friend he likes to jaw with all day about who knows what. Strange fella in a trench coat. I can't make heads or tails of it.",

        "434144880701894656": "Yes, you're still inside the Labyrinth, if you can believe it. It's a total recreation of aspects of the environment outside, down to the atmosphere.",
        "434144881163268096": "But even more astonishing is the scale of it all. It's actually bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. A total mind-bender!",
        "434144881654001664": "Not everything here will make sense at first, or maybe ever. So just do what you do best: explore, collect, and figure out how best to navigate this place.",
        "434144882119569408": "Knowing your way around and understanding how things work here will prove valuable in time.",
        "434144882580942848": "When parts of the Labyrinth begin to shimmer and explode with radiant light, you need to watch out.",
        "434144883059093504": "I call them Prisma Disruptions. They are the unstable bursts of energy generated by the Prismacore. They come in waves, so learn to spot them and how to survive them.",
        "434144883512078336": "Because though the disruptions are dangerous, they will prove essential for our work here... in time.",
        "434144883965063168": "Ok Beatrix, you know where to find me if you need me.... Well, sort of.",
        "434160849277054976": "Have you watched the sunset inside the Labyrinth? The darkness of night creeps in and yet- it's all an illusion. Or at least, it has to be...",
        "434160851747500032": "Speaking of darkness, what's with those shadowy slimes I've seen?",
        "434160852200484864": "Why did you trust me with all of this, Gigi?",
        "434160852657664000": "I better keep moving.",
        "434160853140008960": "Shadow slimes are a strange variant of slimes that seem to be the opposing polarity of the Prismacore made manifest.",
        "434160853597188096": "I still don't know if they were specifically created by someone to be this kind of opposing force, or if they evolved to be that way. You know, how nature always seems to find a way?",
        "434160854066950144": "Either way, shadow plorts seem to provide a kind of dampening effect to prisma disruptions. It's a longshot but maybe they can somehow be used to negate the effects of the Prismacore.",
        "434160854532517888": "Got any Shadow Slime tips?",
        "434160855006474240": "They're slippery little fellows, aren't they? Shadow slimes will quickly flee from you or prisma disruptions. So your best bet is to search areas that were not recently under the effects of a prisma disruption.",
        "434160855480430592": "Once you do see a group of them you need to sneak up on them and then try to knock out as many plorts as possible before they all flee. So be sure to bring some extra junk in your vacpack just for that.",
        "434160855937609728": "Just don't go chasing one off a ledge or something. I'm definitely not speaking from experience there... oof.",
        "434160856415760384": "I'm no hero, Beatrix. So I knew that I needed a real hero to stop what is happening here.",
        "434160856881328128": "And a hero... well, a hero you can trust. I mean if you can't then who else is there? So I tried to picture the perfect person for this job and it was you.",
        "434160857334312960": "I've had my trust broken before. That's what caused everything to go wrong. I trusted the wrong people. But this is my chance to make it right.",
        "434160857791492096": "You might not feel it yet, but you are a hero Beatrix. You will become one in time. There are so many amazing adventures ahead of you, I promise.",
        "434160858261254144": "In time, this will be just another chapter in the Adventures of Beatrix LeBeau. Another story for some little girl to read under a tree and dream that her life might ever be as grand a tale...",
        "434160858726821888": "Happy to shed some light for you whenever you need it.",
        "434166468247711744": "It's so easy to get lost in thought admiring this strange architecture and wondering where it all came from, isn't it?",
        "434166470726545408": "Who do you think built this place?",
        "434166471175335936": "What about you, Gigi? Where are you from?",
        "434166471632515072": "I think it's time I head out.",
        "434166472085499904": "There is much evidence across the Far, Far Range that someone or something was here long ago. There are crumbling ruins and the remains of ancient technological devices all over the planet.",
        "434166472546873344": "These ruins have always been perplexing because they don't seem to have specific functions, at least that we can understand. Not to mention all the slime statues you see everywhere!",
        "434166473004052480": "But the Labyrinth is different. I believe it was built with a specific purpose in mind.",
        "434166473478008832": "And what purpose is that?",
        "434166473964548096": "I think the Prismacore was discovered long ago and this Labyrinth is actually a containment and research facility that was built around it.",
        "434166474417532928": "They couldn't stop the effects of the Prismacore so they just tried to prevent it from affecting the rest of the Far, Far Range while they looked for a solution.",
        "434166474862129152": "The Labyrinth was designed to be a self-sustaining ecosystem. I think this was to simulate parts of Rainbow Island and see what the Prismacore would do to it over time.",
        "434166475315113984": "Outside the Labyrinth you have seen mostly chromatic changes to the world, but inside, where the effects are amplified, elemental properties will shift entirely.",
        "434166475772293120": "We'll find a way to stop it.",
        "434166476250443776": "In time, I hope so. Always in time...",
        "434166476711817216": "A hard question to answer I guess. I'm actually from not too far from where you now call home. But we would have never crossed paths until now.",
        "434166477168996352": "I was born on the Far, Far Range. It's my home and it's all I've ever known outside of books.",
        "434166477621981184": "So when I first discovered Rainbow Island it felt so genuinely new, like finding a secret room in your childhood home. I wanted to stay there forever.",
        "434166478079160320": "But now it feels as though I've lived many lifetimes. My childhood was one of them, and my life on Rainbow Island another. And now that I'm back, well, I suppose that's another. But it's getting fuzzy.",
        "434166478590865408": "What do you mean?",
        "434166479039655936": "The way I managed to get back, to get another chance to fix what is happening here... well, it wasn't your typical way of traveling. And so now my head is always a little foggy, a little mixed up.",
        "434166479530389504": "The memories I have now feel rearranged, like they're out of order. Sometimes what I did yesterday will feel so distant, like a half-remembered thing from my childhood...",
        "434166479983374336": "...and those same childhood memories of mine will suddenly be crystal clear, sometimes even feeling new.",
        "434166480478302208": "My earliest memory has always been sitting underneath our dining room table and watching my mom vacuum the living room. She didn't know I was there and I just watched her.",
        "434166480927092736": "I remember that it was a hot day and she looked tired and upset about something. And that used to be it.",
        "434166481380077568": "But since I came back, that memory has changed. I'm still under the table and she's still vacuuming. The day is hot and she is tired...",
        "434166481862422528": "...But then she notices me. And her expression suddenly moves to surprise and joy and she stops what she's doing.",
        "434166482319601664": "She kneels down and we talk about something but I can't hear my own words. I just see her listening and smiling.",
        "434166482772586496": "Happy exploring!",
        "434169717507911680": "What an incredible view... so easy to get lost in the beauty of it. That is, until a Prisma Disruption turns it all to chaos.",
        "434169719974162432": "Yeah, finding your way around here is hard enough without them.",
        "434169720464896000": "I thought that might be the case, so I have been developing a gadget that should prove useful to you.",
        "434169720938852352": "I call it a Disruption Detector and it does exactly that: placing them around the Labyrinth will tell you when a Prisma Disruption is about to happen in that area. It even works on your map!",
        "434169721408614400": "I'll give you one I made myself as well as the blueprint so you can fabricate as many as you need.",
        "434169721878376448": "How do I use the Disruption Detector again?",
        "434169722331361280": "How do I acquire Prisma Plorts?",
        "434169722817900544": "I need to be on my way.",
        "434169723275079680": "Don't worry, I get a little jumbled up in the head sometimes too. Part of the side effects of, well...",
        "434169723770007552": "Anyway, using a Disruption Detector is easy. Just fabricate one and drop it anywhere in the Labyrinth where you want to track Prisma Disruptions.",
        "434169724218798080": "Once placed, a Disruption Detector will then let you know if a Prisma Disruption is about to happen or is currently happening in that area.",
        "434169724671782912": "Prisma Plorts can be acquired within the chaotic Prisma Disruptions that happen all over the Labyrinth. Prismatic Disruptions will cause areas to suddenly glow with prismatic energy, intensifying over time.",
        "434169725158322176": "During these disruptions, you can find food on the ground that has become unstable from the effects of the Prismacore. If you feed this food to slimes, those slimes will produce an Unstable Plort.",
        "434169725653250048": "Unstable Plorts? How do I stabilize them?",
        "434169726093651968": "Unstable plorts can be stabilized into Prisma Plorts using stabilizers that you will find in the Labyrinth. Based on my findings, they come in two forms.",
        "434169726567608320": "First are the large, ring-like Ancient Stabilizer devices you will find tucked away in the Labyrinth. They're big and hard to miss.",
        "434169727016398848": "Then there are the ethereal Temporal Stabilizers that randomly appear as small, golden rings of energy during Prisma Disruptions. Disruptions are chaotic so keep your eyes peeled.",
        "434169727490355200": "In either case, shooting Unstable Plorts through these rings will yield Prisma Plorts. And with Ancient Stabilizers you can even leap through them to stabilize all your plorts at once. It's fun!",
        "434169727981088768": "Happy exploring!",
        "434189984019935232": "It seems you're awfully good at finding secrets. Took me forever to find this spot.",
        "434189987203411968": "Secrets seem to be the building blocks of this place.",
        "434189987656396800": "Speaking of secrets, why did you pretend to be an AI?",
        "434189988105187328": "On to the next secret then...",
        "434189988549783552": "It would seem that way. I suspect part of its strange layout is that the Labyrinth was built upon over time. And eventually more creative solutions had to be developed to make it even bigger than it could be.",
        "434189989002768384": "Creative solutions?",
        "434189989472530432": "You know the way that the Labyrinth appears bigger on the inside than it is outside? I think that was somehow technology adapted from the Prismacore itself.",
        "434189989963264000": "Because while this sounds crazy, the Prismacore's energy in its most concentrated form seems to be able to bend reality itself.",
        "434189990416248832": "I think the Labyrinth was eventually expanded to try to contain all of the Prismacore's energy, and then when that wasn't working, some kind of reality-bending technology was used to make it even bigger.",
        "434189990873427968": "But then at some point everything started failing. And the Prismacore's energy is now radiating out across Rainbow Island.",
        "434189991326412800": "I'm sorry, but I had to be sure I could trust Viktor, and I needed to know he could figure out what I couldn't. You see, the doors to the Labyrinth were locked to you but not to me. At least, not any more.",
        "434189991829729280": "When I first encountered the Prismacore, before I got here, when the catastrophe occurred... it left me marked in a way. I tried to shield myself from the blast. I survived, but something was different.",
        "434189992282714112": "Part of the energy signature of the Prismacore is now a part of me. It's why I can't get too close to it and why I need you to help me.",
        "434189992735698944": "So you need to understand that I just couldn't have it all happen again. If I were to hand over the keys to this place to the wrong person... Well, you'll just have to trust me that this is our last chance at this.",
        "434189993218043904": "There's no going back for me.",
        "434189993696194560": "If anyone can find it it's you, Beatrix.",
        "434192420939919360": "I like to call this place Dream Land. I used to make my way up here and while away the hours among the clouds. It's a nice place to forget about your problems.",
        "434192423401975808": "Is this where the Labyrinth generates its atmosphere?",
        "434192423859154944": "Do you have any dreams, Gigi?",
        "434192424307945472": "I think it's time I explore this Dream Land myself.",
        "434192424760930304": "Yes, I think so, maybe even more. There is something different in the air here. It's hard to explain. But it feels almost as if the clouds and even the islands you stand on now are formed from the ether around you.",
        "434192425192943616": "Not built or assembled, but more gathered from tiny nothings in the air. I've spent a long time on these islands and sometimes I swear I could begin to feel a kind of flow to it. Like I was gaining control over it.",
        "434192425650122752": "One day I was feeling homesick while I sat here and thought about how when I was little I would be out in my mom's garden in the evening and I would start to smell supper cooking from our house.",
        "434192426132467712": "I used to delight in seeing vegetables growing right in front of me while smelling their cooked aromas in the air. It felt like things were connected in a way.",
        "434192426606424064": "And then while I sat here I closed my eyes trying to picture that garden again and in that moment I swear I could smell supper cooking.",
        "434192427101351936": "When I opened my eyes there was a new island in the distance ahead of me, and on it was the house I grew up in. But it was only there for a moment before fading into the clouds...",
        "434192427579502592": "I used to have lots of dreams. I wanted to break free of the expectations my parents had for me. I wanted to be in charge of my own path. So I dreamed of running away and becoming whoever I wanted to be.",
        "434192428028293120": "I dreamed that one day they would see the person I became and be so happy for me. And everything would be fine somehow. It wouldn't matter that I left them behind.",
        "434192428472889344": "But when you're young, you sometimes don't see just how broken things are that are right in front of you. Your version of the world is like a foggy bathroom mirror. The shape of things but not the details.",
        "434192428925874176": "I know now that my mom never got over my grandmother's passing. I didn't realize the pressure she felt to continue her legacy and the sadness that just became part of her life... not until long after I was gone too.",
        "434192429374664704": "Now I dream that someday I will make it back home and somehow my parents will understand why I had to leave. I think that's always what it comes down to... you just want them to understand you.",
        "434192429836038144": "Watch your step out here. Dreams can come to an end just like that.",
        "434196761864204288": "Hello Beatrix. Seems you are not lost in the dream just yet.",
        "434196764397563904": "Everything here seems to be turning gold...",
        "434196764867325952": "Do you feel lost, Gigi?",
        "434196765337088000": "Yes, due to Dream Land's proximity to the Prismacore you're seeing some of the worst of its effects.",
        "434196765790072832": "In here I have seen water turn to glass, trees to metal, and whole structures surrounding the Prismacore become nearly invisible before vanishing entirely, as if they just phased right out of reality.",
        "434196766251446272": "Bit by bit all of Dream Land will turn to gold unless we stop it. Where you stand will grow heavy and fall from the sky. In time, the generated atmosphere here will collapse and further destabilize the Labyrinth.",
        "434196766717014016": "And once the Labyrinth falls and the Prismacore's energy radiates across the whole of the Far, Far Range, it will transform this world into something unrecognizable, taking all life on the planet with it.",
        "434196767195164672": "The slimes...",
        "434196767660732416": "Yes, even the tenacious slimes couldn't possibly survive such a catastrophe. But we won't let that happen. You and I will find a way.",
        "434196768130494464": "I feel lost all the time. But maybe never more so than when I traveled across the Glass Desert.",
        "434196768587673600": "You crossed the Glass Desert?",
        "434196769053241344": "Yes, twice actually, if you can believe it. And to be honest it nearly killed me...",
        "434196769531392000": "You see, when I started researching the Glass Desert I discovered that the name was hardly befitting such a place. What I saw was verdant and teeming with life.",
        "434196769996959744": "This is due to a very special kind of water that flows there that can almost magically grow- well, who am I kidding, you know this all quite well.",
        "434196770475110400": "So because of this I didn't prepare well enough. And on my return trip... the Glass Desert earned its reputation.",
        "434196770932289536": "It was a barren wasteland. The winds stung my face and blinded me. And every time I thought I had my bearing the world around me would erupt into flames.",
        "434196771376885760": "How did you find the strength to press on?",
        "434196771855036416": "Gigi pauses for a moment and runs the tatters of her cloak between her fingers.",
        "434196772320604160": "This cloak belonged to my grandmother. Well, it was the blanket that she used to keep around her legs later in life. That's what I saw in photos anyway. And then it belonged to my mother until she gave it to me.",
        "434196772781977600": "Mom used to sew up every tear or fray the moment it happened. So many little stitches that didn't quite match, the way she tried to keep it all together.",
        "434196773243351040": "One day I was sitting on the floor of a cave, listening to the storm rage outside. I was wrapped in my cloak and just crying from the weight of it all. I was tired and it all felt unbearable.",
        "434196773717307392": "And then I felt my mom protecting me. I looked at all the zigzagging stitches wrapped around me and realized she kept it all together for me, whatever it took to do the job.",
        "434196774170292224": "And maybe now it is torn and frayed and will never be the same. But it's still here. It saved me just like we'll save this place. It might never be quite the same but we'll hold it all together, Beatrix.",
        "434196774627471360": "Carry on, Beatrix.",
        "434198584142491648": "I can hardly believe you made it this far, Beatrix. This labyrinth would swallow up a normal person. But you, you're different. I was right to put my faith in you.",
        "434198586608742400": "The Prismacore lies ahead. Maybe together we now stand a chance of stopping this thing and changing the future of the Far, Far Range...",
        "434198587065921536": "The conclusion to our story awaits in our next content update! In the meantime be sure to explore the Labyrinth, chat with Gigi everywhere, and build infrastructure with gadgets to aid your travels.",

        "434629957986709504": "It even works on your map, so be sure to place a bunch and get as much of the Labyrinth covered as possible if you're looking to collect loads of Prisma Plorts, something we'll need when you find me.",
        "434629960771727360": "Well, fun if it weren't for the fact that the world around you at the time is likely exploding with dangerous energies and unstable plorts are flying out of your tank...",
        "434634062582935552": "Either way, it's an adventure, right?",
        "434637451849003008": "In some ways my arrival to this place was just in time. In time and altogether out of it I suppose..",
        "434638300511891456": "...I still don't know if it was real or not.",
        "434639513852735488": "I spent so many days just huddled in caves trying to find the courage to press on. But I knew I had to. I had to get back to Rainbow Island and find a solution.",
        "442195192629063680": "And then she tells me that she is so sorry my grandmother never had the chance to meet me.",
        "442195194155790336": "She puts a hand on my shoulder and is about to say something else but the comm station rings and she turns her head.",
        "442195194625552384": "I can't remember anything more after that.",
        "459162059549601792": "Hi, Beatrix. It looks like there are still some Harmonizers that need to be activated.\r",
        "459162940231806976": "Let’s do this",
        "459163070364282880": "I need to prepare a bit more.",
        "459163407372414976": "Come back when you’re ready. I’ll be waiting.",
        "459163883820183552": "Once more, I’m counting on you, Beatrix.\r",
        "494426433331556352": "I really hope so. My guess is that anything unstable or out of place here is a result of the prisma waves blanketing the Labyrinth and transmuting things. If I could invent something to nullify them in just a localized area, it might be enough for you to uncover where the Harmonizers are hidden.\n",
        "494426435990745088": "How can you build something like that?",
        "494426436498255872": "Got it.",
        "494426436984795136": "Well, for starters, I'll need prisma plorts to make the blueprint. I'll need to run all kinds of prisma tests to figure out the parameters we're working with.",
        "497217680223924224": "Hello again! I’ve linked this Exchange Station to my facility here, so we can exchange things that you find for things I can make.",
        "497217686565711872": "And maybe, the Harmonizers…",
        "528451741088903168": "And by the way, I can also exchange prisma plorts for coins you can spend at a kind of underground market... Something I discovered while looking for some of the special tech I needed to build my facility.\n",
        "503065643299008514": "As for actually building it... those strange shadow slimes might be the answer. Their plorts have a natural dampening effect on prisma waves. Maybe they evolved to do that somehow? They can flatten the wavelengths in order to…",
        "503065643299008515": "Sorry, I'm getting caught up in things here. Just keep an eye out for shadow plorts, as they might be useful later. In the meantime, bring me your prisma plorts, and then I can get to work on the nullifier device.",
        "503065643299008518": "We're getting closer, Beatrix. Let’s see this thing through.",
        "508172740122537984": "I rigged up this hydro shower for emergencies, but there’s no water running to this place, just a lot of pipes. If we can somehow get water running, it will definitely prove useful… trust me.",
        "508173982047563776": "I’ll explain more later.\r",
        "512135795118338048": "Use the Nullifier to open hidden paths in the Labyrinth. Try looking for walls that look strange, as if they were altered by prisma waves.",
        "512137435087007744": "Amazing! You activated all the Harmonizers, so we're almost ready to start the process of stabilizing the Prismacore.",
        "512137648556109824": "To make this work, we're going to need a lot of water, but it looks like you don't have a water tank. Try crafting one at the Fabricator in the Conservatory, then come back and let me know when you're ready.",
        "512137991872475136": "This is it, Beatrix. With the Harmonizers activated, and with your help, I can attempt to stabilize the Prismacore.",
        "512152448220688384": "Beatrix! All the readings from the Prismacore… they’re stable! It’s on a completely different wavelength than before! I… I can feel it.",
        "512404458169856000": "Here it is, Beatrix… the Prismacore.\r",
        "512404595482980352": "I was breathless when I first saw it. Seeing the way light twisted and moved within it, the way it seemed to change with every moment… It was like staring into the infinite. If I only knew then what would become of it, of me... of everything.",
        "512405717933256704": "I’m sorry to have brought you here. To have you pulled you into all this. But it was the only way.\r",
        "512520617573642240": "And like I was saying, I think I can invent something that can uncover hidden areas in the Labyrinth.",
        "512528636512464896": "Keep looking for weird walls. If you use the Nullifier in front of them, it should have some effect and allow you to pass them. Hopefully, you'll find the Harmonizers in there, so we can try to stabilize the Prismacore.",
        "512531865044414464": "I’m counting on you to get those plorts so I can develop the Nullifier blueprint. It’s a shot in the dark, but we have to hold on to hope, Beatrix.",
        "512775262921453568": "It will take a long time for the land to fully heal and effects like prisma disruptions to stop. But Rainbow Island — no, the future of the whole Far, Far Range has been saved. You did it, Beatrix. We did it. And I can’t thank you enough.",
        "512855595578716160": "Now that you have my Nullifier gadget blueprint, go ahead and craft it at the Fabricator in the Conservatory. Then it’s up to you to start looking for those hidden areas behind strange walls.",
        "528438915377033216": "But never mind that. The important part right now is working on that nullifying device. So go get those plorts!",
        "515407435033899008": "Recorded message: Hi, Beatrix! I've left the Exchange Station on automatic. You can deposit prisma plorts to get rainbow coins whenever you want. Have fun!",
        "515408179648688128": "This is a recorded message: You’ve activated all the Harmonizers! Please come talk to me over by the Prismacore. Now the real work begins…",
        "522633243620175872": "Thank goodness you’re back. I was able to shut down the process and clear the room just in time. Really glad I installed that emergency shower!",
        "523379801986854912": "Hi, Beatrix. I've been calling this area the Terrarium.",
        "523379806806110208": "Why 'the Terrarium?'",
        "523379807615610880": "What's this area for? Preservation?",
        "523379808395751424": "I'll head on in to check it out right now.",
        "523379809226223616": "Well... you know, a terrarium is just a container that keeps plants outside of their usual environment.",
        "523379810023141376": "The first time I came through here, that's what it looked like to me. Just a biosphere, though a really beautiful one, with unique food and slimes.",
        "523379810853613568": "And... maybe that's true. It's possible that this is just a way to represent the outside world here in the Labyrinth, safely behind glass.",
        "523379811671502848": "But... I'm no longer so sure.",
        "523379812455837696": "So what do you think it really is?",
        "523379813261144064": "I should probably keep moving.",
        "523379814079033344": "That's the thing, Beatrix. I have no way of knowing, not really. But...",
        "523379814884339712": "I'm very sure the Labyrinth as a whole is a facility that was intended to contain and stabilize the Prismacore. So logically, the Terrarium is here for some Prismacore-related reason.",
        "523379815681257472": "And if I think about what that could be...",
        "523379816478175232": "I wonder if it's a seed bank of some kind. Like, if things went really bad in the future, if the Prismacore became too unstable and really, truly breached... this would be a way to ensure that some of the flora would survive the ensuing calamity.",
        "523379817296064512": "If so, that would mean the Terrarium is basically, well, an insurance policy, so that if the worst happens, there could be a do-over.",
        "523379818080399360": "I mean, relatable.",
        "523379818885705728": "What part of that do you relate to?",
        "523379819695206400": "I'll try to stop it before it gets to that.",
        "523379820555038720": "Well, that's...",
        "523379821393899520": "...",
        "523379822186622976": "O-of course I want to think that my actions in the past might help save the future. I mean, I think it's natural to want to set things up so the future can be better, even if there's no way to know for sure what helps.",
        "523379823033872384": "But...",
        "523379823839178752": "If you think of it another way: to all those who exist in the future, what's happening right now is the past. We want those people of the future to look back at what we're doing and feel like it made all the difference to them.",
        "523379824648679424": "Or, better yet, we want to make it so they never had to worry in the first place.",
        "523379825487540224": "What we do here will make all the difference eventually. I have to believe that.",
        "523379826301235200": "All we can do is live in the moment. I'll head onward.",
        "523379827114930176": "Things are in a bad state, but... there's a lot to see and love here. I hope you can take the time to enjoy it, too.",
        "523380586816630784": "Hi, Beatrix. Fascinating area, right?",
        "523380587600965632": "It's almost like some kind of museum!",
        "523380588435632128": "No time to linger, Gigi.",
        "523380589240938496": "That might be what glass cases say to us, but I believe they're here for another purpose. Actually, I'm convinced that they have something to do with the manipulation of time.",
        "523380590050439168": "I've observed the ones with plants for a while, and I've noticed that time's moving faster inside these cases than outside of them.",
        "523380590868328448": "I think that it must be some way of analyzing the Prismacore's effects on the natural world. Perhaps they're a way to help predict what would happen in the event of a breach.",
        "523380591715577856": "Is it happening with the tiny buildings too?",
        "523380592537661440": "No time to linger.",
        "523380593342967808": "It might be, but I'm not sure.",
        "523380594135691264": "Maybe it is, or maybe it's manipulating space instead... or even a third thing that's so alien to us that we'll never have the context to figure it out",
        "523380594928414720": "There are so many mysteries on Rainbow Island, Beatrix, and I don't think we'll solve even half of them in our lifetimes.",
        "523380595721138176": "Sometimes all you can do is look through the glass and wonder about what's happening on the other side.",
        "523380596513861632": "Do you feel that way often?",
        "523380597340139520": "I've felt that way for a long time, honestly.",
        "523380598174806016": "You know, my whole life was planned out: I'd grow up and then take over the ranch, just like my mom took over from Grandma. One day, I'd pass the ranch down to a child of my own. It was all meant with such love. A beautiful home, our family legacy.",
        "523380598980112384": "To me, it was such a small world, like being in one of these domes here, pressing my hands against the glass and imagining the life I'd be living if I hadn't been born on a ranch.",
        "523380599785418752": "I came here to Rainbow Island to try to live that other life. But I'm trapped again now, this time for real. Isn't it ironic? I'm behind glass, shut away like everything else in here.",
        "523380600670416896": "I'll head out to help free you as soon as I can.",
        "523380601471528960": "I know we have to hurry, but take some time to enjoy what's in front of you, too.",
        "523382731968245760": "Oh no... there's gold here. So even the Terrarium is starting to be affected. At least it's probably still a useful shortcut.",
        "523382733075542016": "The gold's a problem, right?",
        "523382733901819904": "There's a shortcut through here?",
        "523382734740680704": "Time to head on.",
        "523382735625678848": "Anywhere close to the Prismacore can be affected by its reality-altering properties. Materials changing from one to another, switching from solid to liquid or gas, flickering entirely out of existence...",
        "523382736426790912": "Outside the Labyrinth, it's seemingly harmless changes, but here, it's more dangerous. Imagine if the section of the floor you're standing on vanished under you, or if the only door out became a wall of solid rock...",
        "523382737257263104": "And the gold... that seems to be the most potent of the transmutations, and it's probably the fate of this world if left unchecked.",
        "523382738058375168": "It all feels like King Midas from my storybooks.",
        "523382738859487232": "King Midas?",
        "523382739689959424": "It's an old myth about a king named Midas who wished to have all he touched turn to gold. He became rich beyond measure, but soon discovered that he could no longer eat or drink, and withered away.",
        "523382740512043008": "When I first discovered the Prismacore, I was horrified at seeing the whole ecosystem turning to gold. I called for help, but those that arrived saw only the value of that gold.",
        "523382741329932288": "...It ended in disaster when they tried to harness its full power. I won't let that happen again. We can't.",
        "523382742143627264": "So I should hurry and make use of that shortcut?",
        "523382742982488064": "Right, I remember there being one there. Though my memory isn't that reliable these days.",
        "523382743829737472": "Shortcuts are funny things. Space and time are both full of shortcuts, when you think about it — I mean, I used my memories of the area and quantum tech to set up these projectors. That's a kind of time-based shortcut.",
        "523382744668598272": "Physical shortcuts are maybe more recognizable. Knowing there are quick ways back to places you've been before... it can make all the difference, right? It can completely change what you'd otherwise do. I know it has for me.",
        "523382745478098944": "Though I suppose we often find ourselves in the same place in the end, one way or another.",
        "523382746308571136": "Talk to you soon, Beatrix.",
        "523383596829536256": "Beatrix, look out the window. There's so much more out there than I'd realized.",
        "523383597957804032": "Haven't you been there before?",
        "523383598784081920": "So why did you put the projector here?",
        "523383599606165504": "It's amazing... but I'd better press on.",
        "523383600424054784": "I haven't. I don't remember seeing anything out those windows. I saw it for the first time just now when you activated the projector.",
        "523383601229361152": "You know, back then, I really thought I'd walked through the whole facility. I was pretty sure I'd had this whole place mapped out.",
        "523383602017890304": "But times like now, I catch glimpses of what feels like an infinite expanse out there, labyrinth as far as the eye can see. Was it here the whole time and I just... missed it?",
        "523383602810613760": "Maybe it wasn't, though. It might be made using quantum architecture. That means it could be here in a moment and then gone in a flash... or even both here and not here at the same time.",
        "523383603599142912": "I mean, I make use of quantum tech often enough myself. It'd be foolish to overlook the possibility.",
        "523383604450586624": "How have you been using quantum tech?",
        "523383605264281600": "I feel like I should move on before this place vanishes too.",
        "523383606057005056": "Oh, a few ways. You're interacting with one right now.",
        "523383606879088640": "The projectors themselves aren't quantum in nature, but how I placed them was. You've been unlocking all sorts of gates to get here, right? Well, it's not that I've gone through, placed things, and then locked up again behind myself.",
        "523383607663423488": "Back when I first came here, it was all open and unlocked, so I wandered all over the place. I've used quantum technology to place the projectors in places I remember having seen.",
        "523383608443564032": "Though... my memory isn't as reliable as it used to be, so some of them may have gotten lost in transit. I guess we'll find out if and when you activate them.",
        "523383609236287488": "So what memory did you use to place this one?",
        "523383610091925504": "I'll keep looking for the rest, then.",
        "523383610918203392": "Well, I placed this one because I remembered this lovely little tree. Strangely, a memory came back to me all of a sudden...",
        "523383611719315456": "So, there was this one Tabby Slime that was always hanging around the ranch back home. It was just a wild slime, but it came around all the time, and by the afternoon would always just bounce away again.",
        "523383612520427520": "And one day... I decided to follow it.",
        "523383613338316800": "It took me deep into the woods. After a while, it did a wiggle at this huge tree and then began to climb it, just jiggling its way from branch to branch all the way up.",
        "523383614231703552": "I followed it. Partway up, I lost sight of the slime, but I kept climbing. Soon enough, I broke the tree cover, and... oh, Beatrix, I don't know how to put it into words.",
        "523383615057981440": "I'd never been so high up, and I'd never seen so much of the big, wide world. My entire life had been in the acres around my home, and there I could see just... everything. Trees blanketing the Far, Far Range, birds flying above...",
        "523383615863287808": "It took my breath away. I stayed up there for hours until my mom came looking for me. Boy, did she give me an earful.",
        "523383616693760000": "It wouldn't be the last time I disappeared on her to see the wider world...",
        "523383617561980928": "We'll get you out to see the world again.",
        "523383618426007552": "Better make like a tree and leave, then. See you, Beatrix.",
        "523360220731830272": "Hello, Beatrix. \r",
        "523361207534120960": "I want to start by thanking you again. Because of you this world has a future. We all do.",
        "523368386513235968": "I’m sorry to have made this a recording, but I needed to move on, and saying that I’m bad with goodbyes is definitely an understatement.",
        "527356088736706560": "Wait, how is that possible?",
        "527357008383995904": "I’m afraid I still can’t greet you in person. I would have loved to thank you properly. But I’ve locked myself away in the facility on the other side of this room. I’ll try to explain everything. After all you’ve been through to get here, I at least owe you that much.",
        "527357083470426112": "So let’s start over. My name is…\r",
        "527357621113090048": "Gigi Twillgers-West.\r",
        "527357752021512192": "I’m the granddaughter of Hobson and Thora.\r",
        "527359885328412672": "You might not believe this, but… the short answer is that I’m from the future. In my time, I discovered Rainbow Island and the Prismacore, and… things went badly. It was rapidly destabilizing, and when I tried to fix it, I only made it worse. I called the wrong people to help, and they tried to exploit its unnatural power. ",
        "527360055189336064": "Everything quickly fell apart after that. There was an explosion. Prismatic light tore across Rainbow Island and into the atmosphere of the Far, Far Range. I shielded myself from the blast, but my arm… something happened.",
        "527360988719771648": "But where are you, Gigi?",
        "527360902036090880": "But if you’re here, what about back… home?",
        "527361539041816576": "My world — the Far, Far Range in my time… it’s on the brink of disaster. The Prismacore’s energy has blanketed the atmosphere and has begun to warp the environment as it has here: changing trees to metal, water to glass, and even phasing the natural world out of reality.",
        "527361573745487872": "In time, there will be nothing left to sustain the ecosystem. Faced with that… knowing that I had a hand in causing it all… I had to do something. ",
        "527360305023053824": "The energy from the Prismacore imprinted itself on me. I can feel it coursing in my arm despite my efforts to contain it. It’s why I’ve sealed myself away and needed your help: when I get near the Prismacore it causes the destabilization to accelerate, like it’s reacting to its own energy signature.",
        "527363917346402304": "So how did you… travel here?\r",
        "527364226567270400": "Remember during your previous journey in the Glass Desert, where my grandfather led you to a “portal beyond space and time?” When you got there, it seemed like it was ruined.",
        "527364268539670528": "Well, that’s because I had already used it. I was able to direct the one in my world to this point in our timeline. There was just one problem…",
        "527364314953838592": "…It crumbled from the shock of activating when I arrived. I didn’t realize it would be a one way trip.\r",
        "527365295787634688": "So you’re stuck here?",
        "527365580824145920": "Yes. Perhaps there’s a way of repairing the portal, but like so many things here, it’s beyond my understanding. So I have to accept that I will never return home... never see my family again.",
        "527365598020792320": "But it will be worth it if we can somehow stabilize the Prismacore. If we can do that, then not only do we save everything here and now, but it will fix my mistakes in the future. I have to believe that.",
        "527366192357863424": "How do we stabilize the Prismacore?\n",
        "527366405030047744": "In my research here, I have discovered that whoever built the Grey Labyrinth created devices called Harmonizers designed to stabilize the Prismacore… only they just didn’t work. There’s evidence that it was attempted multiple times, each time having the opposite effect and making the situation worse.",
        "528419886759309312": "Oh? What did he say? Never give up? To keep pushing through when all the odds are stacked against you? My mom always said grandpa had a way with words.",
        "527366769041108992": "But if they didn’t work before, how will it work this time?",
        "527367021353660416": "I’ll have to explain later. But I think I have something that maybe they didn’t… something that might allow it to work this time.",
        "527367034532163584": "There’s only one problem: the Harmonizers are lost. There’s no record of where they are located. Heck, there’s no record of what they even look like. I am completely in the dark here and don’t know what to do.",
        "527649944011173888": "Because of you I can dream again, dream about a life I can call my own. Because of you I can finally live as who I was always meant to be. ",
        "527650043873357824": "But there’s still more I need to do. I need to study the ecosystem and ensure that it too can move on despite the damages it endured. But I also need to walk barefoot in the grass. To smell flowers in the wind. ",
        "527650273687662592": "I need to be still and watch the clouds crawl slowly across the sky. And I need to visit a friend and play Go well into the night. ",
        "527650329715175424": "I need to just live, Beatrix.\r",
        "527650471629451264": "The Conservatory is yours now. I know it’s in good hands. The way you have cared for it, for the silly little creatures of this world, and the way you so selflessly aided me here…",
        "527650601434771456": "You have a very good heart, Beatrix LeBeau. And I am very happy to have met you.",
        "527651735931088896": "End Recording",
        "528371201086222336": "It works like this: the Prismacore is constantly emitting a chaotic array of energy waves that seemingly take the form of color in our world. But it’s totally out of sync with our world, in a way that runs deep, like in an elemental way. That’s how it warps reality around it.",
        "528371269646315520": "But this is where you come in. The Harmonizers you activated emit a special energy pulse that reverberates through the whole of the Labyrinth. Combined, they form a kind of harmonious energy wave, and when directed at the Prismacore, it attempts to change it, to make it harmonious too.",
        "528372202270781440": "But you said it was attempted before and never worked?",
        "528372807345270784": "Yes, that’s true. But I think I have something that the architects of this system did not: my arm. \r",
        "528372915524759552": "I can feel the energy waves of the Prismacore in my arm. I can feel its chaos… and so I think I will be able to change its wavelength and create that harmony. Because I’ll be able to feel it myself.",
        "528373981557452800": "Ok, what do you need me to do?",
        "528374290384056320": "Once you’re ready, I’ll begin overlaying the Harmonizer’s wavelengths onto the Prismacore. This will cause incredible disruptions and send the Prismacore into a state of chaos until we can actually stabilize it.\r\n",
        "528374334084509696": "This chaos will have a volatile effect on the world around us, transmuting even slimes into masses of horrible Tarr that will fill this room and ultimately destroy everything unless we do something about it.",
        "528374369555738624": "I’ll need you to fight back and destroy all the Tarr before they destabilize the Prismacore and take us down with it. Normally, water can’t exist here for long. It turns to glass this close to the Prismacore.",
        "528374611244118016": "But the Harmonizers resonate through the water that flows here now. So grab it when you can and wipe out those Tarr!",
        "528375375807016960": "What if things get really out of hand?",
        "528377335033524224": "I’ve got you covered! I’ve rigged a hydro shower above the Prismacore. It only needs to build up enough pressure to be used. So to do that, pack it full of slimes! Not only might it save the day, but you’ll save some slimes with it.\r\n",
        "528378858748669952": "Also, I’ll store the contents of your vac tank during the process so you’ll have plenty of room for slimes.\r",
        "528378932769746944": "I know this all sounds like a lot, and a total long shot. But it’s our only chance.\r",
        "528378958938009600": "So, are you ready?\r",
        "528382405372440576": "Can you explain how all this is going to work again?",
        "528406570288705536": "This is it, Beatrix. With the Harmonizers activated, and with your help, I can attempt to stabilize the Prismacore. Are you ready?",
        "528405914672852992": "I’m ready to give it another shot.",
        "528383473615532032": "When you’re ready, we can try this again. I believe in you.\r",
        "528420089105117184": "You know, your grandfather once gave me some great advice.",
        "528420424708157440": "He said, “Keep your peepers peeled.”",
        "528422067466039296": "But where do we even start?\r",
        "528420990658179072": "Huh? What do you mean?",
        "528421599239106560": "The only way to find something hidden is to look for it.",
        "528422403345903616": "I’ve seen some funny looking walls here. Seems like a good place to start.",
        "528422630249361408": "Beatrix, that’s it! I kept thinking I’d find a door or something I couldn’t enter. But what if they’re hidden in plain sight? I… I think I could make some new tech that you could use to test this theory.",
        "528422765066874880": "Head on over to the Exchange Station on the balcony above and I’ll get you set up!\r",
        "528422907241197568": "On my way!",
        "528428037764182016": "What happens to the Prismacore now?",
        "528428360129998848": "Time will tell, but I think it can remain here as yet another part of this world we all call home. Humans were never part of this world until we landed here one day, and now look at us! We managed to be a part of it all and not destroy it in the process. That’s the way it should be.",
        "528428517668057088": "Even the Prismacore was once lost out in the void of space before it landed here, and now it's part of this world too. It’s got to find its true place in all of this… just like me.",
        "528428667819945984": "So are you free now?",
        "528428859898097664": "I can feel a change in my arm. It's still connected somehow to the Prismacore, but it’s not like before. There is a quiet to it now, just a low hum of energy. It feels… peaceful.",
        "528428932321144832": "I will need to run more tests to truly know, but I think that I might finally be able to leave this chamber. \r",

        "528429399419809792": "I might not see you again for a while. I’m so sorry.\r",

        "108799766553817089": "昨晚我收到一条来自于某种人工智能程序的信息，是用我不认识的代码写的。我现在正在破解。",
        "108799766553817090": "不过我很确信这条信息是从你目前的所在地发来的，也就是神秘的彩虹岛。",
        "108799766553817091": "简单扼要地说就是：一艘神秘的船把你带到一个神秘的岛上，而我接到一条来自这个神秘岛屿的神秘代码，这一切都那么……",

        "108799766553817095": "碧翠丝，我办到了！我应该是破解了那条超级神秘的代码。",
        "108799766553817096": "它复杂到令人惊讶。我相信创建了这条代码的人工智能具备可以跟我一较高下的智能。非常高级……都接近外星人水准了。",

        "108799766553817129": "哦碧翠丝，我整晚都在努力合成送给你的完美礼物。提出假设，测试，把结果扔进垃圾桶，重头再来……",

        "108799766553817131": "这个过程出人意料地简单。",
        "108799766553817132": "你好啊碧翠丝，自从我们相识以来你给予我很多帮助，我想对此表示感谢。在你的支持下，我相信自己已经进步成一个更好的人了。",
        "108799766553817133": "根据我的研究表明，我应该送给你一个小礼品。所以请收下这个。",
        "108799766553817134": "哦碧翠丝，我在整理实验室的时候发现了这个。可能你会用得上吧？它应该还在正常运作。",
        "108799766553817135": "我听别人说，自己用不上的还能拿去送人。收下吧！",

        "108799766553817139": "对不起，碧翠丝。我正处于水深火热之中。具体来说就是，我正处于烤面包机和洗衣机的纠结之中。",
        "108799766553817140": "我又在进行机器人实验了。进展得挺顺利！",
        "108799766553817141": "抱歉碧翠丝，我现在无法参加对话、聊天、闲谈，甚至搞个笑都不行。",
        "108799766553817142": "下次吧？",
        "108799766553817143": "你好碧翠丝！尽管看上去一模一样，我并不是维克多，而是维克多为了接受信息而开发的全息影像，所以这不是我。",
        "108799766553817144": "请留下你的信息，我会确保信息会传递给维克多，而不是给我。",
        "108799766553817145": "你能想象得到吗？碧翠丝·乐步跑去开展了另一段冒险，却都不想着带上她的好姐妹、偶尔是劲敌，兼永远的导师——莫奇·迈尔斯！",
        "108799766553817146": "说真的小碧，下次你再跑去一个危险的未知领域，至少也跟我打声招呼行不行？",
        "108799766553817147": "当你需要我的时候，我希望能在你身边……",
        "108799766553817148": "……帮忙收集那些散布在岛上的所有值钱的资源。",
        "108799766553817149": "什么？你真以为我不会做一点侦察吗？如果监视卫星不能窥探东西，要它们有什么用？",
        "108799766553817150": "……",
        "108799766553817151": "算了，反正你注意安全。这个岛给我一种奇怪的感觉，我会继续到处探查的。",
        "108799766553817152": "哦对了，既然你要到处开采，拿着这个精炼链接，应该能让你轻松些。我会算在你的账上的，回头见喽，小土豆。",
        "108799766553817153": "嘿小碧，你在岛上发现的那些到处都是的无人机……有些蹊跷。",
        "108799766553817154": "嗯？",
        "108799766553817155": "嘿，既然我能在天上布下眼线，我就得好好用它们。我还准备了一支无人机队伍前往那边，并以更实际的方式去探测……好吧跑题了。",
        "108799766553817156": "不管怎么样，那个无人机好像非常先进，像是外星制造的。所以我本来觉得，应该有些外星人和你一样在探索无人岛。但并不是这样的。",
        "108799766553817157": "那个无人机和我们用的非常相像……但对我来说更为熟悉，甚至给我一种似曾相识的感觉。真瘆人！",
        "108799766553817158": "嘿，你别怕，可能只是外星人吧。个头很大还长了三个头，有着巨大的爪子，会抓人或吃人，要么就抓走再吃。",
        "108799766553817159": "哇哈哈哈！",
        "108799766553817160": "回头见，小碧。",
        "108799766553817161": "小碧！我一直找你呢。我分析了一架你在那座岛上发现的无人机，搞明白为什么它让我感觉如此熟悉了。它是我的。",
        "108799766553817162": "或者至少是我以前……在梦里见过的。",
        "108799766553817163": "看过无人机的扫描以后，我知道这架无人机很熟悉，所以就去浏览了一些我过去的史莱姆科技日记。这些日记大多是未来的项目，有时也是测试性技术。",
        "108799766553817164": "你知道，为了让莫奇科技能够在行业里独领风骚，我总是将视角放得很远。唔，不过有时也会想出一些自己一辈子也建造不出来的东西。",
        "108799766553817165": "你找到的那些无人机就属于这种情况：曾在我日记中出现，而当今科技不可能制造出来的东西。它们就是我曾经的梦想啊，小碧！",
        "108799766553817166": "所以，这些我设计的本不可能出现的无人机跳出了日记跑到彩虹岛去了？",
        "108799766553817167": "……",
        "108799766553817168": "或许……或许无人机里有某种档案，我们可以解锁来了解更多信息。我知道那里会有数据日志，但如果是我……嗯，我总是知道如何找到阻拦自己的方法……",
        "108799766553817169": "好吧小碧，我需要一些时间思考，等我有想法了就跟你联系。可能得想个一晚上吧……",
        "108799766553817170": "嘿小碧，有些东西想让你试试。老实说，要是成功了我可能会吓个半死。",
        "108799766553817171": "我制作了一个钥匙设计图：一种特殊的档案密钥，用在你找到的那些无人机上。如果无人机中有档案数据存在，这个钥匙应该可以取得那些档案。",
        "108799766553817172": "我说“应该可以”是因为我自己心里也没底。如果那些无人机真的按照我日记中的设计建造出来，那么我会用这个钥匙取得它们的档案。",
        "108799766553817173": "我知道这些话让人难以置信，但我希望你能试试。如果成功获取档案了，至少也能帮你更多地了解彩虹岛上发生的事……",
        "108799766558011392": "很高兴能帮到你，我还欠你个人情对不对？",
        "108799766558011393": "呃，我什么都没说！把这个破钥匙造出来，先别告诉我它管不管用。",
        "108799766558011394": "要是管用的话，我也没做好心理准备呢。",
        "108799766558011395": "回头见喽小土豆，祝你好运。",
        "108799766558011396": "嘿小碧，有些东西我正打算扔掉，转念一想，小碧那么喜欢我不要的破烂垃圾，那她应该会喜欢这件的。",
        "108799766558011397": "晚点儿再谢我也行。",
        "108799766558011398": "嘿嘿嘿碧翠丝！你猜全宇宙最幸运的人是谁？",
        "108799766558011399": "就·是·你！因为本莫奇·迈尔斯送了你一件礼物！",
        "108799766558011400": "给你时间缓一下。有必要的话你也可以坐一会儿。",
        "108799766558011401": "我说小碧，你之前不是说过想要更多东西吗？",
        "108799766558011402": "唔……不对，好像是我说的。",
        "108799766558011403": "算了算了，好好享受这些东西吧。",
        "108799766558011404": "嘿，小碧，我送了你一件礼物。因为……我也不知道为什么。反正希望你能喜欢。",
        "108799766558011405": "不管你喜不喜欢反正就是送了。",
        "108799766558011406": "哟小碧，给你一点东西，只是“一点”而已。",
        "108799766558011407": "因为我给自己弄了个更气派的。比这个强多了。",
        "108799766558011408": "抱歉小碧，现在没法聊天。我为了某个非常重要的东西忙疯了。",
        "108799766558011409": "比你想要的东西重要多了，抱歉。现在没空听你报告近况。",
        "108799766558011410": "你应该过得不错吧？",
        "108799766558011411": "抱歉小碧，开会要迟到了顺便问句我的发型还不错吧开玩笑的我的发型一向完美无缺我得走了拜！！",
        "108799766558011412": "哼，你会后悔遇见本莫奇·迈尔斯的，就等着——",
        "108799766558011413": "啊，小碧！抱歉，我还以为是另一个电话。我呢，呃，正在跟一个竞争对手解决点事情，聊个天而已。",
        "108799766558011414": "雷猴，碧翠丝！你在吗？是我，奥格登·奥提兹！",
        "108799766558011415": "我听说你正在一个充满秘密和危险的神秘岛屿上进行一次全新的大冒险，或许还有一些尚未被发现的多汁水果或蔬菜存在吧？",
        "108799766558011416": "你知道我不得不问！自从你为我提供了稳定的库卡多巴果供应以来，我在致远牧星达到了进一步的烹饪高度！",
        "108799766558011417": "而且我也吃腻了库卡多巴派、库卡多巴蛋奶酥、库卡多巴布丁、库卡多巴夹肉、库卡多巴夹……库卡多巴。",
        "108799766558011418": "我已经没有灵感……和动力了。",
        "108799766558011419": "要是你有新发现，一定要告诉我。除了美味佳肴，我想了解所有你新发现的动植物。",
        "108799766558011420": "千万别忘了：这个野性世界的一草一木和每一寸土地都是宝贵的，值得我们关注和尊重。",
        "108799766558011421": "还有记得补水！在外冒险会让你大汗淋漓，带上这个水龙头吧。",
        "108799766558011422": "祝你好运，碧翠丝。保持联系，我会为你加油的！",
        "108799766558011423": "碧翠丝！真高兴你联系我了。",
        "108799766558011424": "我看了你发给我的彩虹岛的照片。毫无疑问，这些风景太引人注目了！如此美丽，看得久了，这些色彩仿佛也越来越丰富……",
        "108799766558011425": "……但也有些不自然。很抱歉，不得不说这个地方有些不对劲。",
        "108799766558011426": "如果你还记得，我曾经是一家非常成功的快餐公司的老板，转基因食品是我们的专长。",
        "108799766558011427": "为改变天然食品，让它们长得更大、更快、成本更低廉，我们付出了漫长的努力。但我并不为此感到自豪。因为我曾经为了利益而剥夺了它们美好的部分。",
        "108799766558011428": "我这么说是因为，当看到一种植物时，我仍然可以发现它被不自然地改变过。而你在那个岛上看到的美丽彩虹并不是自然而然地出现在那里的。",
        "108799766558011429": "我不清楚对你来说会不会有危险，但这个岛让我心里有些闹腾。我得再多做些研究，晚些联系你。",
        "108799766558011430": "注意安全啊，我嘅朋友。",
        "108799766558011431": "哈——呵——啊——",
        "108799766558011432": "哎呀，对唔住啦，碧翠丝！我最近一直在熬夜阅读。",
        "108799766558011433": "具体来说就是，我一直在查阅能在致远牧星找到的每一份地区指南和植物研究论文。",
        "108799766558011434": "我本以为，就算彩虹岛的植物如此不同寻常，也应该会在我们能接触到的信息上有所记录。",
        "108799766558011435": "然而我什么都查不到。在哪里都找不到任何提到彩虹色植物的记录。因此，这意味着彩虹岛是最近才变成这个模样的。",
        "108799766558011436": "其实用不着我来告诉你这些吧，因为你已经亲眼见过了。你所描述的那些事，整座岛从中间分裂成两种不同的颜色……",
        "108799766558011437": "对我来说，意味着“意外事件”。",
        "108799766558011438": "你要小心谨慎。自然对我们来说可能非常危险，但只要我们加以防范，就能减少风险。",
        "108799766558011439": "我会继续在我的图书馆里查找可以帮助到你的信息。要是没能帮到你，我就给你烤些松饼！",
        "108799766558011440": "不管怎样，我撑你，碧翠丝。拜拜！",
        "108799766558011441": "雷猴碧翠丝！见到你真高兴。希望你有用心照顾自己，出去冒险前记得吃饱饱哦？",
        "108799766558011442": "我理解情况变得越来越复杂了，你在岛屿尽头见没见到过某种单体结构？",
        "108799766558011443": "吓死个人了！但或许我的直觉是正确的，所有奇怪的植物群都不是自然的……",
        "108799766558011444": "碧翠丝，有些事不合情理。我们在致远牧星上发现的所有遗迹，似乎都没有曾经破坏过环境的迹象。",
        "108799766558011445": "当然，我们也不知道这些遗迹的存在目的和建造者是谁。但我一直觉得他们是尊重这个世界的。",
        "108799766558011446": "但是破坏环境的事可能还是发生了。远足的时候，有时你会为了避免踩碎一朵花而踩到另外一朵。",
        "108799766558011447": "让花儿们继续生长的唯一方法，也许是一开始就别靠近它们。",
        "108799766558011448": "这也并不全都是悲观和绝望的：彩虹岛看起来依然很朝气蓬勃。大自然会寻求平衡，但也不是绝对的。",
        "108799766558011449": "唉，你看我，怎么跟你说教起来了。对唔住啦，碧翠丝。就不耽误你的功夫了。",
        "108799766558011450": "我不知道你会在那些墙壁之外找到什么，但我相信你会做出正确的判断。",
        "108799766558011451": "祝你好运，碧翠丝。",
        "108799766558011452": "嘿我嘅朋友！有个小礼物送给你。并不是自制的，也不是派，更不是自制的派……",
        "108799766558011453": "可我觉得你一样会喜欢的。抱歉不是派……",
        "108799766558011454": "雷猴啊，小碧！我为你买了点东西，希望对你有用。",
        "108799766558011455": "要是你已经有一个了，我也不能退货……多多益善嘛，对不？",
        "108799766558011456": "嘿小碧，我有件特殊的东西要给你！现在给你应该刚刚好……",
        "108799766558011457": "啊，不过现在我有点拿不准了。唔，要是时机不对的话，也别告诉我。我的小心脏承受不了！",
        "108799766558011458": "小碧，关于你的单人冒险生活，有件事我是了解的。那就是，你的朋友们都很惦念你，可你却没法收到足够的提示。",
        "108799766558011459": "所以我来给你发条提示！这条提示是个小礼物。通过它来让你想起我，还有咱们在一起的好时光。拜拜，小碧！",
        "108799766558011460": "嘿我嘅朋友，你过得好不？当我觉得孤单的时候，我就出门为朋友做点事。这样一来马上就觉得舒坦了。",
        "108799766558011461": "这样做代表着我在牵挂你哦。",
        "108799766558011462": "抱歉小碧，现在聊不了天！我所有的非常母鸡都飞出了鸡舍！这可是一场鸡飞狗跳的大动乱！要是我明天还没回信，那就是我被推翻赶下台了。",
        "108799766558011463": "对唔住，小碧。我要从烤箱里拿出一个非常巨大的蛋奶酥，需要我全神贯注一丝不苟。",
        "108799766558011464": "然后我就要开始享用这个非常巨大的奶蛋酥了，同样需要我全神贯注一丝不苟。",
        "108799766558011465": "嘿我嘅朋友，现在没法跟你聊。我有一大盘菜要处理，尤其是处于成熟期的怪洋葱色拉。",
        "108799766558011466": "为此我得吃下很多胡萝卜，这可不容错过！",
        "108799766558011467": "哎呀，这不是碧翠丝·乐步嘛！我正跟老霍聊起你呢。听消息说，你渴望新的冒险，所以就跑去未知的世界了吗？",
        "108799766558011468": "好姑娘！你只需要继续前行，去探索下一个奇妙的地方就好。要是靴子破了洞，就买双新的继续走！",
        "108799766558011469": "我嘛，我的靴子也曾历经风霜，不过我知道还得再来个一两趟冒险。只是得弄清楚是哪个冒险……",
        "108799766558011470": "哎呀，我怎么跟霍布森一样叨叨起来了，他一说起探险、宇宙、烹饪，呃，差不多什么话题都能叨叨好一阵。",
        "108799766558011471": "好了小碧，你加油吧，我会再打给你的。不管是谁，远离家园的时候就会思念它。",
        "108799766558011472": "啊，趁我还没忘，给你点东西，你可以拿它归置你的新地盘。东西并不贵重，但你得尽量让自己的居所舒适嘛。",
        "108799766558011473": "好呀，小碧！彩虹岛的生活怎么样？哎，还用说嘛，肯定开心死了吧！",
        "108799766558011474": "你知道吗，自从听说你开始了新生活，我也好好审视了一下自己的生活，我的“新”生活又是什么呢？",
        "108799766558011475": "霍布森和我都见识过也经历过很多了，在这颗飞沙走石的星球上完成了一个又一个冒险。即使我们相识以后，也从没放慢过脚步。",
        "108799766558011476": "我们正在考虑一起挑战一个新的冒险，只是还没确定去哪里，或是什么样的冒险。",
        "108799766558011477": "也许我们会像你一样，去探索致远牧星上某个隐匿的角落；或是将目光放到其他星球上，就像当年霍布森那样。",
        "108799766558011478": "不管我们决定如何，这都将是一场非同寻常的旅程，因为这次我们俩会彼此分享。这一点让一切都那么令人兴奋！",
        "108799766558011479": "在这个世界上，要找到一个完全适合你的人真的太难太难了。就像在沙漠中找到两片相同的雪花那么不容易。",
        "108799766558011480": "我知道你比谁都明白其中的含义。",
        "108799766558011481": "我永远不会忘记自己有多么幸运。我会善用宇宙赠予我的这些最好的礼物。",
        "108799766558011482": "……",
        "108799766558011483": "加油，姑娘。回头再聊。",
        "108799766558011484": "哎，小碧，能联系到你真好。有件大事要跟你分享，要知道这颗星球上并没有多少人能听我倾诉。",
        "108799766558011485": "我和霍布森一直在琢磨下一段冒险去哪里。我们把对方的旅行日记都读了一遍，想找到一个我们都没去过的地方。",
        "108799766558011486": "虽然也找到几个地方，可没有一个能引起我们兴趣的。或许我们真的放慢脚步了吧？",
        "108799766558011487": "然后我们谈了谈，发现目前我们最享受的还是在我的牧场上彼此陪伴。",
        "108799766558011488": "这座牧场是致远牧星上最早那一批，而我俩也在这里学到了很多东西……我们聊到，要不就把知识传承给下一代吧……",
        "108799766558011489": "于是呢小碧，我们决定组建一个家庭。这是我记事一来第一次有害怕的感觉！",
        "108799766558011490": "我跟霍布森都很独立，我们都不知道该如何做父母，更不用说在致远牧星抚养孩子了。",
        "108799766558011491": "但我很爱那个傻老头，而且一想到有个小家伙用他的眼睛望着我，我脸上就会浮现微笑……",
        "108799766558011492": "我觉得只要能实现，哪怕让我搬座山我都愿意。",
        "108799766558011493": "所以我有事忙了，那么多事要准备！",
        "108799766558011494": "谢谢你听我倾诉。有时候跟人倾诉自己心中的恐惧，才能更勇于面对这些恐惧。",
        "108799766558011495": "保重啊，小碧。",
        "108799766558011496": "好啊小碧，你的探险怎么样了？听说你正忙着解开那里的谜团，听起来可真让人激动！",
        "108799766558011497": "我啊，真想知道为什么带娃会这么难！我爬过那么多山，都比用六角扳手组装婴儿床轻松……",
        "108799766558011498": "算了，我跟霍布森就是想跟你道声谢。没有你的话，我们可能也意识不到想要孩子的意愿。",
        "108799766558011499": "我总能在你身上看到自己的影子。你继承了霍布森的破旧牧场以后我意识到，在这个世界上留下自己的痕迹很重要，但是看到年轻人用自己留下的东西去创新，是非常有意思的事。",
        "108799766558011500": "我很期待见到我们的孩子将来会怎么打理这个牧场，或是走上其他人生道路。",
        "108799766558011501": "所以谢谢你，小碧。我和霍布森都很感激你出现在我们的生活里。我永远都会祝福你的。",
        "108799766558011502": "哦对了，还有件事……",
        "108799766558011503": "霍布森想知道，你本来能用玻璃荒漠古代遗迹里那个古老的装置开启一段宇宙大冒险的，为什么你却决定不这么做？",
        "108799766558011504": "我跟他说，霍布森·推格斯，一个女人要不要穿越星际去旅行，那是她自己的事。可他就是那么固执和好奇。",
        "108799766558011505": "嗯？",
        "108799766558011506": "那东西坏了？不对劲呀……霍布森说他离开之前，已经让那东西准备妥当，可以迎接下一个想要冒险闯荡的人了。",
        "108799766558011507": "好吧碧翠丝·乐步……看来你已经为自己找到了下一个谜题。",
        "108799766558011508": "祝你好运了，小碧！等一切都结束的时候你真应该为自己写本书。肯定会是一个宏大的冒险故事！",
        "108799766562205696": "你好呀，小碧。我想送你点好东西，所以就做了点饼干。可是吧，呃，烘烤不是我的拿手活……",
        "108799766562205697": "霍布森说那些饼干非常……可食用。",
        "108799766562205698": "好吧，最后我还是给你买了点东西，希望你能喜欢！",
        "108799766562205699": "你知道吗小碧，大家都说最好的礼品是饱含心意的礼品。",
        "108799766562205700": "这一件是从商店买的……不过也很有心意对不对？",
        "108799766562205701": "嘿小碧，我知道这是在瞎操心，可我还是担心你一个人能不能胜任那些辛苦的工作……",
        "108799766562205702": "所以我就给你发了一个小护理包。希望它能帮你提提神！",
        "108799766562205703": "哈哈哈，别担心，我会跟她说的！你安静点，我正跟她通话呢！",
        "108799766562205704": "嘿小碧，霍布森想送给你这个……他说你要是不想要，还能拿去当柴火，相当好用！",
        "108799766562205705": "我很想跟你好好聊聊，可我得去接霍布森了。拖拉机又在田地里抛锚了，我会帮你带好的！",
        "108799766562205706": "小碧，抱歉现在不能聊天。暴风雨在我这边闹腾，我煮的这壶咖啡也不消停。这两边我都得留神，得挂了！",
        "108799766562205707": "抱歉小碧，我得把电话线留给霍布森。霍布森有个朋友，是个穿着风衣的怪人，他俩总喜欢天南地北地瞎聊。我是根本不明白他俩在鬼扯什么。",
        "108799766562205708": "亻尔女子月月友亻火亻半",

        "418299640694861829": "是的。我一个人做不到，而且我相信你是唯一能帮我的人。",

        "434144876759248896": "这难道不美吗？尽管发生了这么多事，但是能再次看到这一切，我心里还是有些高兴的……",
        "434144879288414208": "我……是不是还在迷宫里面？",
        "434144879774953472": "我当时在一个有奇怪光线的房间里，周遭变得很疯狂。",
        "434144880240521216": "我要回去探寻一番。",
        "434144880701894656": "没错，你还在迷宫里面，如果你愿意相信的话。这是对外界环境各个方面的全面再现，包括大气。",
        "434144881163268096": "但其实更令人惊讶的是它的空间有多宽阔，那里面比外面还要大，简直让人叹为观止！",
        "434144881654001664": "在这里，并不是所有的事物都在开始的时候合乎常理，抑或是从来都不会合乎常理。所以你只要做最擅长的就好了：比如探索呀，收集呀，再弄清楚探索这里的最佳方式。",
        "434144882119569408": "去熟悉这里的环境，理解事物的运作方式，后面你会因此受益的。",
        "434144882580942848": "当迷宫的某些部分开始闪耀并爆发出辉光时，你需要小心一点。",
        "434144883059093504": "我称之为棱镜干扰，那是棱镜核心产生的一种不稳定能量爆发，这种能量爆发呈波状涌动，所以你要学会辨认它们，学会如何在干扰来袭时生存下来。",
        "434144883512078336": "因为尽管棱镜干扰很危险，但它将对我们在这里的工作至关重要……迟早会的。",
        "434144883965063168": "好了，碧翠丝，如果你需要我，你知道在哪里可以找到我……嗯，差不多吧。",
        "434160849277054976": "你看过迷宫里的日落吗？夜晚的黑暗悄然降临，然而……这一切都是幻觉。或者至少，它必须是……",
        "434160851747500032": "说到黑暗，我看到的那些暗影史莱姆是怎么回事？",
        "434160852200484864": "你为什么要相信我，琪琪？",
        "434160852657664000": "我还是动身吧。",
        "434160853140008960": "暗影史莱姆是一种奇怪的史莱姆变体，似乎是棱镜核心显现出来的相反极性。",
        "434160853597188096": "我仍然不知道是不是谁专门创造出来了这种相反的力量，或者说它们是不是自主进化成这个样子的。你知道的，大自然似乎总是能找到一些平衡的办法。",
        "434160854066950144": "不管怎样，暗影结晶似乎提供了一种抑制棱镜干扰的效果。虽然希望渺茫，但也许我们可以用它来抵消棱镜核心的影响。",
        "434160854532517888": "有什么暗影史莱姆的小知识吗？",
        "434160855006474240": "他们是狡猾的小家伙，不是吗？暗影史莱姆会迅速逃离你或者棱镜干扰。所以最好的办法就是搜索那些最近没有受到棱镜干扰影响的区域。",
        "434160855480430592": "一旦你看到它们成群结队了，就要偷偷接近它们，然后在它们全都逃跑之前，尝试击打获得尽可能多的结晶。所以一定要在你的真空枪里多带些垃圾。",
        "434160855937609728": "只是别追着追着就从悬崖或者什么地方跳下去。我绝对不是以个人经验告诉你的……哎哟。",
        "434160856415760384": "我不是英雄，碧翠丝。所以我知道我需要一个真正的英雄来阻止这里发生的一切。",
        "434160856881328128": "一个英雄……一个你可以信任的英雄。我的意思是，如果你不能，那还有谁能胜任？所以我脑海中试图勾勒出的这项任务的完美人选，那就是你。",
        "434160857334312960": "我以前也被人背叛过，这就是导致一切出错的原因。曾经有人枉费了我的信任，但这是可以让我弥补错误的机会。",
        "434160857791492096": "你可能还没感觉到，但你是个英雄，碧翠丝。你迟早会成为英雄的。我保证，前路还有很多精彩的冒险等着你。",
        "434160858261254144": "很快，这将成为碧翠丝·乐步历险记的新篇章，供世界某个角落的小女孩在树下阅读欣赏，并梦想着自己的人生会像这故事里的一样辉煌……",
        "434160858726821888": "我很乐意在你需要的时候为你提供一些帮助。",
        "434166468247711744": "人们很容易沉醉其中，一边欣赏这奇怪的建筑，一边好奇它出自谁手，不是吗？",
        "434166470726545408": "你觉得这地方是谁建的？",
        "434166471175335936": "那你呢，琪琪？你来自哪里？",
        "434166471632515072": "我想我该走了。",
        "434166472085499904": "致远牧星各地有很多证据表明，很久以前有人或有什么东西就住在这里。星球上到处都是摇摇欲坠的废墟和残余的古代技术设备。",
        "434166472546873344": "这些废墟总是令人困惑，因为它们似乎没有的特定功能，至少在我们认知范围内没有。更别提到处都是史莱姆雕像了！",
        "434166473004052480": "但是迷宫不一样，我相信它是为了一个特定的目的而建造的。",
        "434166473478008832": "那目的是什么呢？",
        "434166473964548096": "我认为棱镜核心很久以前就被发现了，这个迷宫实际上是一个围绕它建造的容器和研究设施。",
        "434166474417532928": "他们无法阻止棱镜核心带来的影响，所以他们只是在尝试阻止它影响致远牧星的其余部分，与此同时寻找解决办法。",
        "434166474862129152": "迷宫被设计成一个自给自足的生态系统。我认为这是为了模拟彩虹岛的部分地区，看看棱镜核心随着时间的推移会对它产生什么影响。",
        "434166475315113984": "在迷宫之外，你已经看到了世界的大部分都变成了五颜六色的样子，但是在迷宫之内，效果会被放大，元素属性将完全改变。",
        "434166475772293120": "我们会想办法阻止它的。",
        "434166476250443776": "总有一天会的。总有一天……",
        "434166476711817216": "这个问题还是很难回答的。其实我的故乡，距离你现在称之为家的地方不算远，只是我们之前从未相遇过。",
        "434166477168996352": "我就在致远牧星出生。这里是我的家，这里是我除了书本以外所知道的一切。",
        "434166477621981184": "所以当我第一次发现彩虹岛的时候，它给我的感觉是耳目一新的，就像童年的时候在家里发现了秘密房间一样。当时，我都想永远留在那里。",
        "434166478079160320": "但现在感觉好像我已经活了很多世一样。我的童年就是其中一世，我在彩虹岛上的生活算是另外一世。现在我回来了，我想这又是另一世了。但现在，好像一切都变得模糊不清了。",
        "434166478590865408": "什么意思？",
        "434166479039655936": "我获得了一次回来重新解决这里的问题的机会，但我是怎么回来的嘛……嗯，不是寻常使用的旅行方式。所以现在我的脑子总是有点乱七八糟的，像一团浆糊。",
        "434166479530389504": "我现在的记忆像被重新洗了牌一样，乱七八糟的。有时候，我昨天做过的事会让我感觉很遥远，就像是我已经变得模糊的童年记忆中的一件事……",
        "434166479983374336": "……而我童年的记忆会有时会突然变得清晰，甚至感觉那是最近才发生的事。",
        "434166480478302208": "我最早的记忆一直是坐在餐桌底下看着妈妈打扫客厅。她不知道我在那里，而我就那么看着她。",
        "434166480927092736": "我记得那天特别热，她看起来很疲惫，而且心烦意乱的。最早的记忆以前就是这个。",
        "434166481380077568": "但自从我回来，那段记忆就变了。我还是在桌子底下，她还在打扫。天气很热，她很疲惫……",
        "434166481862422528": "……但是她注意到我在那里了。她的表情突然变得又惊又喜，然后她停下了手头的家务。",
        "434166482319601664": "她跪了下来，我们聊了一些事情，但我听不到我自己说了什么。我只看到她在倾听，在微笑。",
        "434166482772586496": "祝你探索愉快！",
        "434169717507911680": "真是令人难以置信的景色……太容易沉醉其中了。也就是说，棱镜干扰的出现让一切都陷入了混乱。",
        "434169719974162432": "是啊，要是没有它们，在这里找路就够难的了。",
        "434169720464896000": "我也觉得是这样，所以我一直在开发一个应该会对你有用的装置。",
        "434169720938852352": "我把它叫做干扰探测器，把它放在迷宫周围，它就会告诉你什么时候棱镜干扰会在那个区域发生。甚至在你的地图上也有效！",
        "434169721408614400": "我给你一个我亲手做的，还有设计图也给你，这样你就可以根据需要多做一些了。",
        "434169721878376448": "能再说一遍我该怎么使用干扰探测器吗？",
        "434169722331361280": "我该怎么获得棱镜结晶？",
        "434169722817900544": "我得走了。",
        "434169723275079680": "别担心，我的脑子有时候也会有点乱。副作用的一部分，嗯……",
        "434169723770007552": "不管怎么说，干扰探测器用法并不复杂。只需要造一个，再把它放在迷宫里任何你想追踪棱镜干扰的地方。",
        "434169724218798080": "一旦放好，干扰探测器就会告诉你那里会不会发生棱镜干扰，或者当前是否正在发生棱镜干扰。",
        "434169724671782912": "迷宫的各处都会发生产生混乱的棱镜干扰，届时你就可以获得棱镜结晶了。棱镜干扰将导致该区域突然散发出棱镜能量，并且该能量会随着时间的推移不断加强。",
        "434169725158322176": "在棱镜干扰期间，你可以在地面上找到食物，这些食物已经因为棱镜核心的影响而变得不稳定。如果你把这些食物喂给史莱姆，那些史莱姆就会产生一个不稳定结晶。",
        "434169725653250048": "不稳定结晶？那我该如何稳定它们？",
        "434169726093651968": "你可以使用在迷宫里找到的稳定器，将不稳定结晶稳定成棱镜结晶。根据我的发现，它们有两种形式。",
        "434169726567608320": "第一种是巨大的环状古代稳定器装置，它们就藏在迷宫里。这些装置外形很大，很容易发现。",
        "434169727016398848": "第二种是无形的时间稳定器，它们会在棱镜干扰期间随机出现，样子是金色的小型能量环。棱镜干扰会带来混乱，所以你得睁大眼睛仔细寻找。",
        "434169727490355200": "在任何情况下，向这些能量环射击不稳定结晶都将产生棱镜结晶。如果找到了古代稳定器，你甚至可以从中跳过去，一次性稳定自己所有的结晶。很好玩的！",
        "434169727981088768": "祝你探索愉快！",
        "434189984019935232": "看来你非常擅长寻找秘密，我花了很长时间才找到的这个地方。",
        "434189987203411968": "这个地方似乎是由秘密堆砌而成的。",
        "434189987656396800": "说到秘密，你为什么要假装是人工智能？",
        "434189988105187328": "去找下一个秘密吧……",
        "434189988549783552": "看起来确实如此。我怀疑迷宫之所以布局奇特，部分原因是它随着时间的推移不断被扩建。最终，为了使其变得更大，不得不发展出更具创造性的解决方案。",
        "434189989002768384": "创造性的解决方案？",
        "434189989472530432": "你知道迷宫的里面比在外面看着要大吗？我认为这是某种从棱镜核心改造而来的技术。",
        "434189989963264000": "因为虽然这听起来很疯狂，但棱镜核心的能量在其最集中的形式下似乎能够扭曲现实本身。",
        "434189990416248832": "我认为迷宫最终被扩建，是为了尝试容纳棱镜核心的所有能量，然后当这不起作用时，就使用了某种扭曲现实的技术来使其变得更大。",
        "434189990873427968": "但后来在某个时刻，一切都开始失效。而棱镜核心的能量现在正在彩虹岛上四处扩散。",
        "434189991326412800": "我很抱歉，但我当时必须确定我能信任维克多，我需要知道他能否解决我解决不了的问题。你看，迷宫的门对你来说是锁着的，但对我来说不是。至少，现在不是了。",
        "434189991829729280": "在我最初遇到棱镜核心时，在我来到这里之前，在灾难发生之时……它以某种方式给我留下了标记。我试图用防护措施来抵御爆炸。我活了下来，但有些东西变得不同了。",
        "434189992282714112": "棱镜核心的能量特征现在已经成为我的一部分。这就是为什么我不能离它太近，以及为什么我需要你的帮助。",
        "434189992735698944": "所以你得明白，我只是不能再让一切重演。如果我将这个地方的钥匙交给了错误的人……嗯，你得相信我，这是我们最后的机会了。",
        "434189993218043904": "我回不了头了。",
        "434189993696194560": "如果说有谁能找到它，那就是你，碧翠丝。",
        "434192420939919360": "我喜欢把这个地方叫做梦幻之地。我过去常常来到这里，在云朵之间消磨时光。这是一个忘却麻烦的好地方。",
        "434192423401975808": "这是迷宫产生大气的地方吗？",
        "434192423859154944": "你有什么梦想吗，琪琪？",
        "434192424307945472": "我觉得是时候由我自己去探索这片梦幻之地了。",
        "434192424760930304": "是的，我想是的，甚至不止大气。这里的空气中有些异样的东西，用语言很难解释，但感觉几乎就像是你周围的云朵，甚至你现在站立的岛屿，都是由你周围的虚空形成的。",
        "434192425192943616": "它不是建造或组装起来的，而更像是从空气中微小的虚无领域聚集而来。我在这些岛屿上待了很长时间，有时我发誓我能感受到它在流动，就像我开始对它有了控制力一样。",
        "434192425650122752": "有一天，我坐在这里时突然有点想家。我回想起小时候，傍晚时分我会在妈妈的花园里，开始闻到我们家房子里飘来的晚餐香味。",
        "434192426132467712": "我过去喜欢一边看着蔬菜在我面前生长，一边闻着空气中飘来的它们被做熟后的香气。这感觉就像是事物会以某种方式联系在一起。",
        "434192426606424064": "然后当我坐在这里时，我闭上眼睛试图再次想象那个花园，就在那一刻，我发誓我能闻到晚餐的香味。",
        "434192427101351936": "当我睁开眼睛时，面前的远处出现了一座新的岛屿，上面正是我成长过程中住过的房子。但它只出现了一会儿，然后就消失在云层中了……",
        "434192427579502592": "我曾经有很多梦想。我想要摆脱父母对我的期望。我想要掌控自己的道路。所以我梦想着摆脱束缚，成为我想成为的那个人。",
        "434192428028293120": "我梦想着有一天他们会看到我成为的那个人，并为我感到高兴。一切都会自然而然地变好，就算我离开了他们也没关系。",
        "434192428472889344": "但当你年轻时，你有时根本意识不到眼前的事物是多么的支离破碎。你对世界的看法就像是一面雾蒙蒙的浴室镜子，能看到事物的轮廓，却看不清细节。",
        "434192428925874176": "我现在知道了，我母亲从未从我外婆的去世中走出来。我没有意识到她为了延续传统所承受的压力，以及那种成为她生活一部分的悲伤……直到我离开很久之后才懂。",
        "434192429374664704": "现在我梦想着有一天我能回到我的家，我的父母也会理解我为当初不得不离开的苦衷。我想，归根结底……你只是希望他们能理解你。",
        "434192429836038144": "小心脚下，梦想可能就像这样戛然而止。",
        "434196761864204288": "你好啊，碧翠丝。看来你还没有迷失在梦中。",
        "434196764397563904": "这里的一切似乎都在变成金子……",
        "434196764867325952": "你感到迷茫了吗，琪琪？",
        "434196765337088000": "是的，由于梦幻之地靠近棱镜核心，你正在看到它产生的最糟糕的一些影响。",
        "434196765790072832": "在这里，我见过水变成玻璃，树木变成金属，整个围绕棱镜核心的结构都变得几乎看不见，然后完全消失，就好像它们直接从现实位面蒸发了一样。",
        "434196766251446272": "如果我们不阻止，梦幻之地的每一寸都将变成金子。你站立的地方将变得沉重并从天空坠落。随着时间的推移，这里产生的大气将崩塌，从而进一步破坏迷宫的稳定性。",
        "434196766717014016": "一旦迷宫坠落，棱镜核心的能量会辐射到致远牧星的每一个角落，将这个世界变得面目全非，并带走这个星球上的所有生命。",
        "434196767195164672": "那些史莱姆……",
        "434196767660732416": "是的，即使是顽强的史莱姆也不可能在这样的灾难中幸存。但我们不会让这种事情发生。我们会找到办法的。",
        "434196768130494464": "我一直都感到迷茫。但没有什么比穿越玻璃荒漠时更让我迷茫了。",
        "434196768587673600": "你穿过了玻璃荒漠？",
        "434196769053241344": "没错，实际上穿过了两次，你敢信吗？说真的，我差点死在那儿……",
        "434196769531392000": "你看，当我开始研究玻璃荒漠时，我发现这个名字跟这个地方一点都不搭，因为我看到的是郁郁葱葱、生机勃勃的景象。",
        "434196769996959744": "这是因为那里流淌着一种非常特别的水，它几乎可以用神乎奇迹的方式促进生长。好吧，我在开玩笑，你对那地方的情况了如指掌。",
        "434196770475110400": "所以正因如此，我才没有做好充分的准备。而在我返回的途中……玻璃荒漠为自己正名了。",
        "434196770932289536": "那是一片贫瘠的荒地。风像刀子一样刮在我的脸上，迷了我的眼睛。每次我以为我找到了方向，我周围的世界就会燃烧起火焰。",
        "434196771376885760": "你是如何找到继续前进的力量的？",
        "434196771855036416": "琪琪停顿了一会儿，用手指拨弄着她的斗篷。",
        "434196772320604160": "这件斗篷是我外婆的，其实这是她晚年时用来盖在腿上的毯子，至少我在照片上看到的是这样。然后毯子传给了我母亲，直到她又把它给了我。",
        "434196772781977600": "妈妈过去总是在它一有破损的时候就把它缝补好。这么多细小杂乱的针脚，就像她努力维持生活的方式。",
        "434196773243351040": "有一天，我坐在一个洞穴的地面上，听着外面呼啸而过的风暴。我裹着斗篷，因为这铺天盖地的重压而哭泣。我很疲惫，身边的一切压得我喘不过气。",
        "434196773717307392": "突然我感觉到我的母亲在保护我。我看着周围这些七扭八歪的针脚，意识到她缝缝补补、维系一切的努力都是为了我，哪怕要为之付出代价。",
        "434196774170292224": "也许现在它已经破烂不堪，再也回不到以前的样子。但它仍然在这里。它救了我，就像我们将要拯救这个地方一样。也许这里再也回不到以前的样子，但是我们将共同维系这一切，碧翠丝。",
        "434196774627471360": "坚持下去，碧翠丝。",
        "434198584142491648": "难以置信，你已经走到了这么远，碧翠丝。这个迷宫会把一个普通人吞噬殆尽。但你，你与众不同。我选择信任你，当真是个明智的决定。",
        "434198586608742400": "棱镜核心就在前方……也许现在我们联手，就有机会阻止这一切，改变致远牧星的未来……",
        "434198587065921536": "我们故事的结局将在我们下一次内容更新中揭晓！与此同时，请大家一定要探索迷宫，随时随地和琪琪聊天，以及使用装置建设基础设施来帮助你踏上旅途。",
        "434198587523100672": "非常感谢大家对《Slime Rancher》的支持、反馈和热爱。我们迫不及待地想让大家看到接下来会发生什么！",
        "434198587980279808": "下次内容更新会在什么时候？",
        "434198588420681728": "我该如何让《Slime Rancher》变得更好？",
        "434198588886249472": "我真的、真的很喜欢史莱姆。",
        "434198589339234304": "我准备好回去探寻一番了！",
        "434198589813190656": "你可以在社交媒体上关注《Slime Rancher》，或者在<style=\"weblink\"><link=\"https://gsght.com/c/4l9e90\">slimerancher.com</link></style>订阅我们的时事通讯，掌握第一手资料。",
        "434198590266175488": "没有游戏社区的支持，就没有《Slime Rancher》的今天。你可以通过为《Slime Rancher》打分评论、直播游戏或与社区其他成员讨论游戏内容的方式来支持我们。",
        "434198590719160320": "即使是告诉你的一个朋友、亲戚，或者特别有影响力的邻家猫咪，也算是在帮助我们建立游戏的口碑！",
        "434198591176339456": "它们也非常非常爱你。",
        "434627962089402368": "我见过水变成玻璃，花变成金属，宛如地狱。",
        "434627965256101888": "然后她的表情又变了。她仍然在微笑，我看到她的眼角含着泪花，但她忍住没让泪水滴下来。",
        "434629957986709504": "它甚至可以在你的地图上显示，所以如果你希望收集大量的棱镜结晶，一定要多放置一些，并尽量多覆盖迷宫区域。棱镜结晶可是你找到我时我们会需要的东西。",
        "434629960771727360": "嗯，如果当时你周围的世界不会发生危险的能量爆炸，也不会有不稳定结晶从你的罐子里飞出来……那倒是挺有趣的。",
        "434634062582935552": "不管怎样，都是一次冒险，对吧？",
        "434637451849003008": "从某种意义上来说，我来得正是时候。可以说是遵照了时间，同时跨越了时间。",
        "434638300511891456": "……我还是搞不清楚真假。",
        "434639513852735488": "我在山洞里蜷缩了好多天，都还没能找到继续前进的勇气。但我知道我必须这么做。我必须回到彩虹岛，找到解决办法。",
        "442195192629063680": "然后她对我说，她一直因为祖母没能和我见上一面而耿耿于怀",
        "442195194155790336": "她把手放在我的肩膀上，想说些什么，但通讯站就在这个时候响了起来，她转过头看向通讯站。",
        "442195194625552384": "之后的事情，我就都不记得了。",
        "428361726019923968": "碧翠丝！我收到了“人工智能”的另一条信息。自从你抵达彩虹岛，我一直在与之沟通。",
        "428361726045089792": "这条信息对我来说有点私密，但也包含了对你至关重要的信息，为了最全面地呈现所有信息，我将逐字逐句地阅读...",
        "428361726045089793": "咳咳！ ",
        "428361726045089794": "“维克多，谢谢你这些日子一直和我聊天，我越来越了解你了。我必须承认，我与你通信是为了验证你的科学能力。",
        "428361726045089795": "我们的通信不仅让我确信了你的能力，而且出乎意料地，处于黑暗岁月中的我也因此获得了安慰和陪伴。",
        "428361726045089796": "我一直在尝试开发一种装置，但始终无法完成。现在，我将它的局部设计图发给你，如果你能完成它，我相信这会是进入灰色迷宫的钥匙。 ",
        "428361726045089797": "请你谅解，维克多，我从来没想过要欺骗你。但为了解决问题，我需要知道我可以信任谁。如果有朝一日问题解决，我很希望我们能见个面。",
        "428361726045089798": "我很想继续一边喝咖啡一边下围棋，直到太阳再次升起。”",
        "428361726045089799": "... 信息就是这些了。",
        "428361726045089800": "我收到了一份复杂的局部结构设计图，说实话，上面都是些外星代码。我花了几天时间分析它，并对其做出了修改。现在，我想我已经完成了这个装置，它应该能执行预期的任务了。",
        "428361726045089801": "至少我希望如此。坦率地说，我不想让这个人失望，我觉得我... 欠这位朋友一个人情。",
        "428361726045089802": "因此，请允许我按照这位朋友的指示，向你发送完成的设计图。这似乎是一个需要你在迷宫入口附近使用的设备，但我也只知道这么多了。",
        "428361726045089803": "如果不确定如何使用它，那就随意试试吧！这是了解未知的唯一途径。",
        "428361726045089804": "祝你好运，碧翠丝。我们现在都指望你了。",
        "497217680223924224": "又见面啦！我把这个交换站和我的设施连接起来了，这样你找到的东西就能换我做的物品了。",
        "497217686565711872": "说不定……还有和谐器……",
        "494426433331556352": "我真希望如此。我猜这里所有不稳定的异常现象，都是棱镜波覆盖迷宫后产生的物质嬗变。如果能发明一种局部抵消装置，说不定就能帮你找到和谐器在哪儿。\n",
        "494426435990745088": "这种装置要怎么造？",
        "494426436984795136": "首先需要棱镜结晶来制作设计图。我得进行各种棱镜测试来确定参数范围。",
        "503065643299008514": "至于实际建造……那些暗影史莱姆可能是关键。它们的结晶能天然抑制棱镜波，或许是进化出的特性？它们能平抑波长从而……",
        "503065643299008515": "抱歉，我有点跑题了。总之多留意暗影结晶，之后肯定用得上。现在先把棱镜结晶带给我，我就能开始研制中和装置。",
        "494426436498255872": "懂了。",
        "503065643299008518": "我们离真相越来越近了，碧翠丝。这次一定要解开谜题。",
        "512531865044414464": "就靠你收集那些结晶来开发中和器设计图了。虽然希望渺茫，但我们必须坚持下去，碧翠丝。",
        "512855595578716160": "现在你有了我的中和器装置设计图，去温室的制造器制作它吧。接下来就靠你寻找那些奇怪墙壁后面的隐藏区域了。",
        "512528636512464896": "继续寻找那些奇怪的墙壁。如果在它们面前使用中和器，应该会产生效果让你通过。希望你能在里面找到和谐器，这样我们就能尝试稳定棱镜核心了。",
        "515408179648688128": "这是条录音信息：你已经激活了所有和谐器！请来棱镜核心这边找我。现在真正的工作要开始了……",
        "515407435033899008": "录音留言：嗨，碧翠丝！交换站已设为自动模式，随时可以存入棱镜结晶兑换彩虹币。玩得开心！",
        "459162059549601792": "碧翠丝，看来还有几个和谐器需要激活。\n",
        "512135795118338048": "用中和器开启迷宫的隐藏通道，注意寻找那些被棱镜波扭曲的异常墙面。",
        "512137435087007744": "太棒了！你激活了所有和谐器，我们马上就能开始稳定棱镜核心的流程了。",
        "512137648556109824": "不过这个操作需要大量水源，你似乎还没准备储水罐。去温室的制造器制作一个，准备好了就来找我。",
        "508172740122537984": "这个应急喷水花洒是我临时组装的，可惜这里只有管道没有水源。要是能通上水肯定能派上大用场……相信我。",
        "508173982047563776": "详情我稍后再解释。\n",
        "459162940231806976": "我们开始吧！",
        "459163070364282880": "我还需要做些准备。",
        "459163407372414976": "等你准备好了再来找我，我会在这里等着。",
        "459163883820183552": "碧翠丝，这次也要靠你了。\n",
        "512137991872475136": "就是现在了，碧翠丝。既然和谐器都已激活，加上你的协助，我有把握稳定棱镜核心了。",
        "512152448220688384": "碧翠丝！棱镜核心的所有读数……全都稳定了！它的波长和之前完全不同！我……我能感受到这种变化。",
        "512404458169856000": "看啊碧翠丝……这就是棱镜核心。\n",
        "512404595482980352": "初次见到它时，我几乎忘记了呼吸。看着光线在其中扭曲流动，每分每秒都在变幻……就像凝视着无限本身。如果当时就知道它、我……以及这一切会变成什么样……",
        "512405717933256704": "很抱歉把你带到这儿来，让你卷入这一切。但这是唯一的办法。\r",
        "512520617573642240": "就像我刚才说的，我觉得我能发明一种装置来揭示迷宫中隐藏的区域。",
        "512775262921453568": "棱镜干扰效应需要很久才会停止，这片土地也才能恢复。但彩虹岛——不，整个致远牧星的未来都得救了。你做到了，碧翠丝。我们做到了！真的感激不尽。",
        "522633243620175872": "谢天谢地你回来了。我及时终止了进程并清理了房间，真庆幸我安装了那个紧急淋浴装置！",
        "523379801986854912": "嗨，碧翠丝。我把这个区域叫做生态箱。",
        "523379806806110208": "为什么叫“生态箱”？",
        "523379807615610880": "这个区域是用来保存什么的吗？",
        "523379808395751424": "我现在就进去看看。",
        "523379809226223616": "嗯……你知道的，生态箱就是一个让植物脱离原生环境的容器。",
        "523379810023141376": "我第一次经过这里时，它给我的就是这种感觉。就像一个生物圈，虽然是个非常美丽的，有着独特食物和史莱姆的生物圈。",
        "523379810853613568": "而且……也许确实如此。这可能只是用玻璃安全地将外部世界展现在迷宫中的一种方式。",
        "523379811671502848": "但……我现在不那么确定了。",
        "523379812455837696": "那你觉得它究竟是什么？",
        "523379813261144064": "也许我该继续前进了。",
        "523379814079033344": "问题就在这儿，碧翠丝。我真的无从得知。但是……",
        "523379814884339712": "我十分确定整个迷宫是为了封存并稳定棱镜核心而建造的设施。那么按逻辑来说，生态箱的存在必然与棱镜核心有关。",
        "523379815681257472": "如果让我推测其用途……",
        "523379816478175232": "我在想这是否是某种种子库。比如当未来情况恶化，棱镜核心彻底失控爆发时……这里能确保部分植物在灾难中幸存。",
        "523379817296064512": "若真如此，生态箱本质上就是份保险——当最坏的情况发生时，还能有重来的机会。",
        "523379818080399360": "倒是能理解。",
        "523379818885705728": "你理解哪部分？",
        "523379819695206400": "我会尽力阻止那种情况发生。",
        "523379820555038720": "这个嘛……",
        "523379821393899520": "……",
        "523379822186622976": "当、当然我也希望过去的所作所为能拯救未来。即便无法确定哪些努力会奏效，但是人们本能地想要创造更美好的未来。",
        "523379823033872384": "但……",
        "523379823839178752": "换个角度想：对于未来的人们而言，此刻发生的一切都是过去。我们希望后人回望时，能感受到此刻的抉择改变了他们的命运。",
        "523379824648679424": "更理想的情况是——我们此刻的努力让他们根本无需担忧。",
        "523379825487540224": "我们在此所做的一切终将改变未来，我必须相信这点。",
        "523379826301235200": "活在当下才是正道，我继续前进了。",
        "523379827114930176": "虽然现状糟糕……但这里仍有许多值得发现与珍爱的事物，希望你也愿意驻足欣赏。",
        "523380586816630784": "碧翠丝，这区域很奇妙对吧？",
        "523380587600965632": "简直像座博物馆！",
        "523380588435632128": "没时间驻足观赏了，琪琪。",
        "523380589240938496": "玻璃展柜或许给人这种印象，但我认为它们另有用途。事实上，我确信这些装置与时间操控有关。",
        "523380590050439168": "我观察这些植物展柜很久了，发现里面的时间流速比外界更快。",
        "523380590868328448": "这应该是用来分析棱镜核心对自然界影响的装置。或许能借此预测核心失控时的后果。",
        "523380591715577856": "那些微缩建筑也是这样吗？",
        "523380592537661440": "没时间驻足观赏了。",
        "523380593342967808": "有可能，但我不确定。",
        "523380594135691264": "也许是空间扭曲……或是某种我们完全无法理解的第三类现象。",
        "523380594928414720": "彩虹岛有太多未解之谜了，碧翠丝，恐怕我们穷尽一生也破解不了半数。",
        "523380595721138176": "有时候你只能隔着玻璃，揣测另一侧正在发生什么。",
        "523380596513861632": "你经常有这种感觉吗？",
        "523380597340139520": "说实话，这种感受伴随我很久了。",

        "523380598980112384": "但对我来说，那就像被困在这些玻璃罩里，把手贴在玻璃上幻想着——如果没出生在牧场，人生会怎样？",
        "523380599785418752": "我来彩虹岛就是为了体验另一种人生。可现在又被困住了，这次是真的。多讽刺啊？我和这里的展品一样被关在玻璃后面。",

        "523382743829737472": "捷径真是奇妙。仔细想想，时空本身充满捷径——比如我用记忆结合量子科技搭建这些投影仪，就是种时间层面的捷径。",
        "523382744668598272": "实体捷径可能更直观。知道有返回旧地的近路……会彻底改变决策对吧？至少对我而言确实如此。",

        "523383602017890304": "但像现在这样，我偶尔会窥见无边无际的迷宫，延展到视野尽头。难道它们一直存在，只是……我被一叶障目了？",
        "523383602810613760": "或许它本就不存在。可能是量子建筑——转瞬即逝……甚至同时处于存在与不存在的叠加态。",
        "523383603599142912": "毕竟我自己也常用量子科技，忽视这种可能性就太蠢了。",

        "523383605264281600": "感觉该趁这里消失前继续前进了。",
        "523383606057005056": "有好几种方式，你现在就在和其中一种互动。",
        "523383606879088640": "投影仪本身并非量子产物，但部署方式利用了量子特性。你解锁了各种闸门才到达这里对吧？其实我并非亲自穿过那些门布置设备。",
        "523383607663423488": "最初到来时这里完全开放，我得以自由探索。后来用量子技术将投影仪部署在记忆中的位置。",
        "523383608443564032": "不过……记忆力大不如前，有些投影仪可能在传输中遗失了。等你激活时自会知晓。",

        "523383610091925504": "我会继续寻找其他投影仪。",
        "523383610918203392": "选择这里是因为记得这棵可爱的小树。奇怪的是，有个记忆突然浮现……",
        "523383611719315456": "从前牧场有只野生的喵喵史莱姆总在家附近的牧场晃悠。每天都准时来，下午它又都会蹦跳着离开。",
        "523383612520427520": "有天……我决定跟踪它。",
        "523383613338316800": "它带我深入树林，对着一棵巨树扭动身体开始攀爬，颤悠悠地从树枝间弹跳上升。",
        "523383614231703552": "我跟了上去。中途跟丢了，但仍继续攀登。当拨开树冠时……碧翠丝，我不知该如何形容。",
        "523383615057981440": "从未到达那样的高度，从未见过如此广阔的世界。原本生活半径只有家园周边，此刻却能看到……一切。覆盖致远牧星的树海，翱翔的飞鸟……",
        "523383615863287808": "这让我感到甚至无法呼吸。我在那里呆了几个小时直到母亲找来，当然我挨了顿狠骂。",
        "523383616693760000": "那不会是我最后一次为看世界而消失……",
        "523383617561980928": "我们会让你重见天日的。",
        "523383618426007552": "该像树叶般飘走了。回见，碧翠丝。",
        "523360220731830272": "你好，碧翠丝。\n",
        "523361207534120960": "首先要再次感谢你。因为你，这个世界才有了未来。我们所有人都是。",
        "523368386513235968": "很抱歉只能用录音留言，但我必须继续前进，而不擅长告别这种说法实在太过轻描淡写了。",
        "527356088736706560": "等等，这怎么可能？",
        "527357008383995904": "恐怕还是无法当面致谢。我多想亲自向你道谢。但现在我已将自己封锁在房间另一侧的设施里。我会试着解释一切，你历经千辛万苦来到这里，我至少欠你这个。",
        "527357083470426112": "让我们重新开始。我的名字是……\n",

        "527357752021512192": "我是霍布森和索拉的孙女。\n",
        "527359885328412672": "你可能难以置信……简而言之，我来自未来。在我的时代，我发现了彩虹岛和棱镜核心……然后事情就失控了。核心急速失稳，而我的干预反而加剧了危机。我找错了帮手，他们只想榨取这种异常能量的价值。 ",
        "527360055189336064": "随后一切迅速崩坏。爆炸发生时，棱镜光焰席卷彩虹岛，直冲致远牧星大气层。虽然躲过冲击波，但我的手臂……发生了异变。",
        "527360305023053824": "棱镜核心的能量烙印在我身上。尽管竭力抑制，却仍能感受到它在臂膀中奔流。这就是我必须自我隔离并需要你协助的原因：我靠近棱镜核心就会加速失稳，就像能量在自我呼应。",
        "527360902036090880": "那你的世界……牧场的大家……",
        "527360988719771648": "琪琪，你现在究竟在哪里？",
        "527361539041816576": "我的世界——那个时代的致远牧星……已濒临毁灭。棱镜核心的能量笼罩大气，开始扭曲环境：树木金属化，水体玻璃化，现实正逐渐土崩瓦解。",
        "527361573745487872": "终将没有任何生态系统能够存活。面对这一切……明知自己是始作俑者……我必须采取行动。 ",
        "527363917346402304": "那你是怎么……穿越到这里的？\n",
        "527364226567270400": "还记得上次的玻璃荒漠之旅吗？我祖父曾指引你寻找“超越时空的传送门”，当你找到时它已损毁。",
        "527364268539670528": "其实是因为我先行使用了它，我将未来世界的传送门定位到这条时间线。但有个致命问题……",
        "527364314953838592": "……穿越激活时的冲击使它崩塌了，我没想到这会是个单程旅行。\n",
        "527365295787634688": "所以你被困在这里了？",
        "527365580824145920": "是的。或许有修复传送门的方法，但就像这里的许多事物一样，这已超出我的理解范畴。所以我必须接受再也回不了家……再也见不到家人的事实。",
        "527365598020792320": "但如果我们能稳定棱镜核心，这一切就值得。成功的话，不仅能拯救当下，还能修正我在未来犯下的错误。我必须相信这点。",
        "527366192357863424": "我们该如何稳定棱镜核心？\n",
        "527366405030047744": "在此研究期间，我发现灰色迷宫的建造者设计过名为和谐器的装置……但它们从未起效。有证据表明多次尝试都以反效果告终，每次都让情况恶化。",

        "527367021353660416": "稍后再解释。但我想我掌握着前人没有的关键……或许这次能成功的变量。",
        "527367034532163584": "唯一的问题是：和谐器都遗失了。没有位置记录，甚至连外形描述都没有。我完全束手无策。",
        "527649944011173888": "因为你，我重新拥有了梦想，梦想着能主宰自己的人生。因为你，我终于活成了本该成为的模样。 ",
        "527650043873357824": "但仍有未竟之事。我需要研究生态系统，确保它在遭受创伤后仍能延续。同时我也想赤足踏过草地，细嗅风中的花香。 ",
        "527650273687662592": "我需要静静看云卷云舒，也需要与好友对弈至深夜。 ",
        "527650329715175424": "我只是需要活着，碧翠丝。\n",
        "527650471629451264": "现在温室托付给你了，它在你手中定会安然无恙。你照料它的方式，关爱那些小生灵的样子，以及无私协助我的身影……",

        "527651735931088896": "录音结束",
        "528371201086222336": "原理是这样的：棱镜核心持续发射混乱的能量波，在我们世界呈现为彩色光纹。但它与我们的世界存在根本性的不协调，这种不协调深入物质层面，故而能扭曲现实。",
        "528371269646315520": "而你的作用就在这里。你激活的和谐器会发射特殊脉冲，在整个迷宫产生共鸣。它们共同形成和谐能量波，当它们作用于棱镜核心时，也就会试图更改它的频率。",
        "528372202270781440": "但你说前人尝试都失败了？",
        "528372807345270784": "没错。但我拥有建造者们没有的优势：我的手臂。\n",
        "528372915524759552": "我能通过手臂感知棱镜核心的能量波动。感受它的混乱……因此我相信能调整波长，创造和谐。因为这次我能亲身体验。",
        "528373981557452800": "明白了，需要我做什么？",
        "528374290384056320": "等你准备好后，我会开始将和谐器的波长叠加到棱镜核心上。这将引发剧烈扰动，使棱镜核心陷入混沌状态——直到我们真正将其稳定下来。\n",
        "528374334084509696": "这种混沌会对周围世界产生剧烈影响，甚至将史莱姆异变成可怕的焦油怪。它们将充斥整个房间并摧毁一切，除非我们及时干预。",
        "528374369555738624": "我需要你全力反击，在焦油怪破坏棱镜核心并拉我们陪葬之前消灭它们。正常情况下，水在这里无法长期存在——过于接近棱镜核心会让水瞬间玻璃化。",
        "528374611244118016": "但此刻和谐器正与流淌于此的水流共振。所以抓住机会取水，彻底消灭那些焦油怪！",
        "528375375807016960": "要是局面彻底失控该怎么办？",
        "528377335033524224": "我早有准备！我在棱镜核心上方安装了喷水花洒。只需积蓄足够压力即可启用，所以多往里面塞些史莱姆！不仅能化解危机，还能顺便拯救些小家伙。\n",
        "528378858748669952": "另外在此过程中我会储存你的真空储槽中的东西，这样就能装下更多史莱姆。\n",

        "528382405372440576": "能再解释下具体操作流程吗？",
        "528383473615532032": "等你准备好我们可以再试一次。我相信你。\n",
        "528405914672852992": "我准备好再试一次了。",
        "528406570288705536": "就是现在了，碧翠丝。既然和谐器都已激活，加上你的协助，我有把握稳定棱镜核心了。准备好了吗？",
        "528419886759309312": "哦？他说什么？永不言弃？当全世界都与你为敌时仍要坚持到底？妈妈总说外公最擅长鼓舞人心。",

        "528422630249361408": "碧翠丝，就是这样！我总以为会找到一扇进不去的门之类的东西。但如果它们就藏在显而易见的地方呢？我……我觉得我能开发些新装备来验证这个猜想。",
        "528422765066874880": "快去阳台上的交换站，我这就给你准备好！\n",
        "528422907241197568": "马上到！",
        "528428037764182016": "棱镜核心现在会怎样？",
        "528428360129998848": "时间会给出答案，但我觉得它可以留在这里，成为这个我们称之为家园的世界的一部分。人类本不属于这里，直到某天我们降临此地——看看现在的我们！我们成功融入了这个世界，而非将其摧毁。这本就该如此。",
        "528428517668057088": "就连棱镜核心也曾迷失在太空虚空中，最终坠落于此。如今它也成为这个世界的一部分。它需要找到自己真正的归宿……就像我一样。",
        "528428667819945984": "所以你现在自由了吗？",
        "528428859898097664": "我能感到手臂的变化。它仍以某种方式连接着棱镜核心，但已不同往昔。现在只有平静的能量低鸣。这种感觉……很安宁。",
        "528428932321144832": "还需要更多测试才能确定，但我想我终于能离开这个密室了。\n",

        "528429332436774912": "有件必须完成的事。我该去告诉某个人，我母亲曾多么努力——我也多么努力，但我终究无法成为那个人。还有我母亲每天都为自己不是那个人而感到内疚……",
        "528429399419809792": "可能很久都无法再见了，对不起。\n",

        "108799766553817105": "正直、悪い気はしない。\nこれまで僕は、常に質問を投げる側だった。問いを見つけ、その答えを得るために研究にいそしむ…僕の人生は、そのくり返しだった。",

        "108799766553817118": "…AIは、「私も」と発言したのだ。",
        "108799766553817119": "僕は返答に窮し、しばし画面を見たまま固まってしまった。\nするとAIは、みずからの発言の意味を初めて理解したかのように、唐突に通信を終えてしまったのだ。",

        "108799766558011468": "感心だわ！その調子でどんどん旅をして、まだ見ぬフシギと出会ってちょうだい。歩きすぎてブーツに穴があいたら、新しいブーツにはきかえて、また出発よ！",
        "108799766558011469": "私のブーツはもう、だいぶくたびれてしまったけれど、まだ冒険の人生から足を洗ったわけじゃないわ。自分がどんな旅をしたいのか、それさえわかれば…",
        "108799766558011470": "あら、いやだ…私ったら、ひとりでしゃべっちゃったわ。これじゃまるで、ホブソンが探検だの宇宙だの料理だの…自分がしゃべりたいことをしゃべり出したときとおんなじ。",
        "108799766558011471": "ふるさとから遠くはなれていると、ふと人さみしくなることもあるわ。誰だってそう。しっかりがんばりなさいな。\nまた連絡するから、様子を聞かせてちょうだいね。",
        "108799766558011472": "そうそう、これはお引っ越し祝いよ。大したものじゃないけれど、少しは新居の居心地がよくなると思うの。使ってみてちょうだい。",
        "108799766558011473": "ベアトリクス！レインボー島での暮らしはどう？\nそんなステキな名前の島だもの、きっと楽しいでしょうね！",
        "108799766558011474": "あなたが新しい冒険を始めたと聞いて、私も自分の人生についていろいろ考えたの。私が今から「新しく始める」としたら、どんなことかしら、って。",
        "108799766558011475": "ホブソンも私も、このハルカーナ星で、冒険の人生を歩んできたわ。2人出会って以降も、それはまったく変わっていない。",

        "108799766558011477": "あなたのように、ハルカーナ星の未踏の地を探検するのもよさそうだし…いっそ昔のホブソンみたいに、別の星を目指すというのも、ありかもしれないわね。",
        "108799766558011478": "なんにせよ、次の旅は特別なものになるわ。だって、2人でいっしょに体験できるんですもの。\n旅の楽しさは、どこで何をするかより、誰と行くかで決まるのよ！",
        "108799766558011479": "こんなにも自分にぴったりな相手が見つかるなんて、本当に奇跡ね。まったく同じ模様の雪の結晶を、砂漠で見つけるようなものよ…",
        "108799766558011480": "…あなたはきっと、私以上に、そのありがたみをわかっているでしょうね。",
        "108799766558011481": "自分がどれほど恵まれているか、私は決して忘れないわ。\nこの世界が私のために用意してくれた贈り物の数々を、ありがたく受け取って、生きていきたい。",

        "108799766558011483": "ベアトリクスも、元気ですごしてちょうだいね。\n近いうちに、また連絡するわ。",
        "108799766558011484": "ベアトリクス…！よかった…あなたにぜひ、聞いてもらいたい話があるの。\nこの星には、人の話をゆっくり聞いてくれる人って、なかなかいないでしょう…？",
        "108799766558011485": "ホブソンと2人で、どんな冒険に出かけようか、話し合ってみたの。おたがいの旅日記を読み返して、2人ともまだ行ったことのない場所を探してみたわ。",
        "108799766558011486": "いくつか候補は見つかったけれど、どこもピンとこなくてね。私たちもとうとう、落ち着きたい年頃になったのかしら…なんて思ったりして…",
        "108799766558011487": "…でもね、そんなふうによく話し合ってみて、わかったの。\r\n私たちにとってのいちばんの幸せは、この牧場で、2人で暮らすことなんだって。",
        "108799766558011488": "この牧場はね、ハルカーナ星に最初に人が移住してきて、まもないころにできたの。ホブソンも私も、ここでいろいろなことを学んだわ。\nだから…それを誰かに受けついでもらうのがいいんじゃないかって…",
        "108799766558011489": "…それでね、私たち…この牧場で、家庭を築くことにしたの！\nだけどそうと決まったとたんに、私、急に不安になってしまって…これまで生きてきて、怖いものなんてなんにもなかったのに…",
        "108799766558011490": "ホブソンも私も、ずっとひとりでやってきたから、子どもの育て方なんて、ぜんぜんわからない。ましてや、ハルカーナ星での子育てなんて…",
        "108799766558011491": "それでも、ホブソンは私の大切な人。あの人と同じ目をした子どもが、こちらを見ている姿を想像するだけで、自然と笑顔になってしまうわ。",
        "108799766558011492": "その想像が現実になるなら、どんな困難だって乗り越えられる気がするのよ。",
        "108799766558011493": "そうと決まったら、やることがたくさん！いそがしくなるわ…",
        "108799766558011494": "話を聞いてくれてありがとう。不安になったときは、誰かに話すだけで、「ひとりじゃない」って思えて、心強いものね。",
        "108799766558011495": "ベアトリクス、あなたも、自分を大切にね。",
        "108799766558011496": "ベアトリクス！冒険は順調？\nその島は、ナゾがいっぱいなんですってね。話を聞くだけで、私もワクワクするわ！",
        "108799766558011497": "こっちは、赤ちゃんをむかえる準備に悪戦苦闘中よ…\nこんな小さな六角レンチでベビーベッドを組み立てるなんて…山登りのほうがうんとラクだわ！",
        "108799766558011498": "それはそうと、ホブソンも私も、あなたには本当に感謝しているの。あなたがいなかったら、私たちきっと、自分たちの望みが子どもを育てることだなんて、気づけなかったもの。",
        "108799766558011499": "あなたを見ていると、自分の若い頃を思い出すわ。あなたがホブソンの牧場を立て直すのを見て、自分たちがこの世界に残したものには、自分で思っている以上に価値あると気づいたの。それを若い人が引きついで、新しいものを生み出してくれるなんて、ステキなことじゃない？",
        "108799766558011500": "私たちの子どもは、この牧場を引きつぐかしら。それとも、どこか別の場所へ旅立つのかしら。\nいずれにせよ、この目で見るのが本当に楽しみ。",
        "108799766558011501": "そんなことに気づけたのも、あなたと知り合えたおかげ。だから、ありがとう、ベアトリクス。\n私はいつも、あなたの幸せを願っているわ。",
        "108799766558011502": "そうそう…",
        "108799766558011503": "ホブソンが不思議がっているのよ。あなたがどうして、ルリ砂漠の遺跡で大昔の巨大装置を使わなかったのか…どうして、宇宙の果てへの大冒険に出発しなかったのか、ってね。",
        "108799766558011504": "でも、そんなのはあなたの勝手よね。理由なんて、いちいち人に説明することはないわ。\r\nだけどね、ホブソン・ツイルガーズという人は、知りたがり屋なうえに、あきれるほどガンコ者で…",
        "108799766558011505": "…え？",
        "108799766558011506": "装置が壊れていた…？ヘンね…\nホブソンは、いつでも使える状態にしたまま、その場を立ち去ったと言っていたわ。「次にそこにたどりつく、野心あふれる冒険家のために門を開いておいた」って。",
        "108799766558011507": "…ベアトリクス。どうやら、新たなナゾを発見してしまったみたいね。",
        "108799766558011508": "でも、あなたならきっと解き明かしてくれるでしょう！\n今回の冒険を終えたら、本でも書いてみたら？きっと、胸おどるような冒険譚になると思うわ！",
        "108799766562205696": "ベアトリクス！あなたに食べてほしくて、クッキーを焼いてみたんだけど…やっぱり、慣れないことはするものじゃないわね…",
        "108799766562205697": "ホブソンは、「食べられないことはない」…って言ってくれたけれど。",
        "108799766562205698": "…とにかく、あなたには別のものをあげるわ。よかったら、使ってちょうだいね！",
        "108799766562205699": "ねえ、ベアトリクス。「心のこもったプレゼントなら、どんなものでもありがたい」って、よく言うでしょう？",
        "108799766562205700": "これにこもっているのは、買ってきたお店の売り場の空気ぐらいだけれど…使ってくれるわよね？",
        "108799766562205701": "ベアトリクス！あなたが牧場の仕事をひとりで全部こなしていること、少し心配しているのよ…\nおせっかいなおばさんで、ごめんなさいね。",
        "108799766562205702": "差し入れを送るから、これでたまには気分転換してちょうだい。",
        "108799766562205703": "あはは…もう！大丈夫よ、ちゃんと伝えておくわ。\n今、本人と通信中だから、静かにしてちょうだい！",
        "108799766562205704": "…ごめんなさい、ベアトリクス！ホブソンが、あなたにプレゼントをあげたいそうなの。\n「いらなかったら、たき火のまき代わりにでもしてくれ」ですって！",
        "108799766562205705": "ベアトリクス！連絡ありがとう。でも、ごめんなさい、これからホブソンをむかえにいくところなの…トラクターがまた立往生してしまったらしくて。\nあなたから連絡があったこと、彼にも伝えておくわね。",
        "108799766562205706": "ベアトリクス！ごめんなさい、今、ちょっと立て込んでいるの。\nご近所でトラブルのニオイがして…それに、今いれているコーヒーの香りも…どちらも様子を見にいかないと…！",

        "523379814884339712": "確かなのは、このラビリンス全体が、プリズマコアの力を抑え込んで\n安定化させるための巨大施設だってこと。\nつまり、当然、このテラリウムも、プリズマコアに関係する理由で\nここに存在してるってことになるわ。",

        "523380590868328448": "おそらくこのケースは、プリズマコアが自然界に与える影響を分析する\nためのものなんだと思う。多分、プリズマコアの力が外にあふれ出た\n場合に、どんなことが起きるのかを予想するためよ。",
        "523380591715577856": "この辺りの小さい建物でも、\n実験してるってこと？",

        "523380598980112384": "でも、私にとって牧場は、まるでこのガラスのドームみたいな、\n狭い世界なの。ガラスの壁に手を当てて、もし牧場の外で生まれて\nいたら、一体どんな人生が歩めたんだろうって想像することしか\nできなかった。",

        "108799766558011471": "알겠어, 베아. 견뎌낼 수 있을 거야. 다시 잘 있나 확인하러 연락하마. 누구든 집이 지평선 너머에 있으면 외로워지기 마련이거든.",
        "108799766558011472": "아, 잊어버리기 전에 줘야 할 게 있어. 큰 선물은 아니지만, 이 정도면 그곳을 편안하게 만들 정도는 되겠지.",

        "108799766558011484": "오, 베아 연락이 돼서 다행이구나. 중요한 소식이 있는데, 이 돌덩어리는 내 말을 들어줄 사람이 별로 없구나.",
        "108799766558011485": "나와 홉슨은 다음 모험에 대해 깊이 생각해 봤단다. 서로의 여행 일지를 읽으면서 한 번도 가보지 못한 곳을 찾아보았지.",
        "108799766558011486": "가보지 못한 곳은 찾았지만, 딱히 가고 싶지는 않았지. 어쩌면 드디어 삶을 조금 천천히 즐길 때가 온 것 같구나.",
        "108799766558011487": "그러다가 얘기를 나누다 보니 깨닫게 된 거지. 내가 이 세상에서 제일 사랑하는 일은 이 목장에서 누군가와 함께 보내는 시간이라는 것을.",
        "108799766558011488": "머나먼 목장 개척 초기에 만들어진 이 목장에 살면서, 우리는 많은 것을 배웠지... 그래서 우린 그 지식을 누군가에게 전해주기로 했고...",
        "108799766558011489": "...그래서 우린 가족을 만들기로 했단다, 베아! 정말 오랜만에 느끼는 두려움이야...!",
        "108799766558011490": "나와 홉슨은 모두 자립심이 너무 강해서 머나먼 목장에서 아이를 키우기는커녕 부모가 되는 것부터도 낯설거든.",
        "108799766558011491": "그래도 난 저 늙은 멍청이를 사랑하고, 작은 아이가 내 눈을 바라보는 생각을 하면 너무나도 기쁘단다...",
        "108799766558011492": "그 생각만 하면 산이라도 움직일 수 있을 만큼 기뻐.",
        "108799766558011493": "그러려면 할 일이 많은것 같군!",
        "108799766558011494": "얘기를 들어줘서 고마워, 베아. 가끔은 걱정을 들어주는 것 만으로도 혼자가 아니라는 기분을 주거든. ",
        "108799766558011495": "잘 지내렴, 베아.",
        "108799766558011496": "안녕 베아, 모험은 어때? 수수께끼를 파헤치는 중이라는 얘기가 있던데, 재밌어 보이는걸?",
        "108799766558011497": "난 어떻게 아기에 관한 건 쓸데없이 복잡한지 생각중이란다. 산을 오르는 게 이 외계인이 쓸법한 렌치로 요람을 만드는 것 보단 쉬웠던 것 같거든...",
        "108799766558011498": "어찌 됐든, 우리는 감사 인사를 하고 싶었어. 네가 없었다면, 우리는 아기를 가지고 싶다는 생각을 못 했었을 거야.",
        "108799766558011499": "난 널 볼 때마다 나를 보는 듯했어. 네가 홉슨의 낡아빠진 목장을 복구했을 땐, 우리가 남긴 것만이 아닌, 젊은 친구가 우리의 유산으로 무언가 새로운 걸 하는 것도 정말 재밌다는 걸 알게 되었지.",
        "108799766558011500": "우리 아가가 이 목장에서 어떤 일을 벌일 지, 혹은 가슴이 뛰는 대로 나갈 지 지켜보는 것도 정말 재밌을 거야.",
        "108799766558011501": "그러니, 고마웠네, 베아. 나와 홉슨은 네가 우리 삶의 작은 일부가 되어주어서 더 나은 삶을 살아가고 있단다. 네게도 좋은 일만 가득하길 바라. 언제나.",
        "108799766558011502": "아, 그러고 보니 한가지 물어볼 게 있는데...",
        "108799766558011503": "홉슨은 네가 왜 유리 사막의 고대 텔레포터를 타고 우주 저편으로 여행을 가지 않았나 궁금해하더라고.",
        "108799766558011504": "그래서 이렇게 말해주었지. '홉슨 트윌거스, 여자가 시공을 넘나들겠다고 결정했다면, 그 결정은 오로지 그 사람의 몫'이라고. 하지만 그의 고집과 호기심은 말릴 수 없었어.",
        "108799766558011505": "...뭐?",
        "108799766558011506": "고장이 났었다고? 그건 말이 안되는데... 홉슨은 그 문은 다음 모험가를 위해 남겨두었다고, 작동 준비를 마치고 돌아왔다고 했었거든.",
        "108799766558011507": "하하, 베아트릭스 르뷰, 또 다른 수수께끼를 마주해 버렸는걸?",
        "108799766558011508": "행운을 빌지, 베아! 일이 다 끝나면 책이라도 써보는 건 어때? 엄청난 모험 이야기가 될 것 같은데!",
        "108799766562205696": "안녕, 베아. 네게 좋은 걸 주고 싶어서 쿠키를 만들어 주려고 했는데 말이다, 제빵은 내 전문 분야가 아니라서 말이지...",
        "108799766562205697": "홉슨에 말에 따르면 내 쿠키는 정말, 정말이지... 먹을 수는 있었대.",
        "108799766562205698": "...어쨌든, 대신 이걸 사 줬으니, 좋아했으면 좋겠다.",
        "108799766562205699": "최고의 선물은 마음이 담긴 것이라고 하지, 베아.",
        "108799766562205700": "이 선물은 상점에서부터 왔지만... 나쁘진 않지?",
        "108799766562205701": "저기 베아야, 난 네가 거기서 혼자 하는 일이 너무 고되진 않을까 걱정이 되거든...",
        "108799766562205702": "그래서 도움이 될만한 걸 좀 보내줬지. 도움이 좀 됐으면 좋겠네!",
        "108799766562205703": "하하하, 걱정 마시게나! 애한테 말 할게! 이제 조용히 좀 해봐. 애한테 얘기할 차례야!",
        "108799766562205704": "베아야, 홉슨이 네게 이걸 주고 싶어 했단다... 받기 싫으면 꽤 괜찮은 불쏘시개로도 써도 된다고 하더라고!",
        "108799766562205705": "언제나 보기 좋구나, 아가야. 지금 트랙터가 다시 고장 나서 밭 한가운데에 있는 홉슨을 데리러 가야 한단다. 인사는 전해주마!",
        "108799766562205706": "베아야, 지금은 대화를 할 수 없을 것 같구나. 폭풍이 몰아칠 준비를 해야 하거든. 아, 커피도 한잔 마셔야 하고. 둘 다 내 손길이 필요해 보이는구나. 먼저 가볼게!",

        "108799766553817146": "Sério, Bia, da próxima vez que você fugir para um território perigoso e inexplorado, poderia pelo menos me avisar?",
        "108799766553817147": "Eu gostaria de poder ajudar caso você precise de mim...",
        "108799766553817148": "...para ajudar a coletar todos esses recursos valiosos que parecem estar espalhados pela ilha.",
        "108799766553817149": "O quê? Você acha que eu não faria um rápido reconhecimento por conta própria? Para o quê servem os satélites de vigilância se não para bisbilhotar vida dos outros?",
        "108799766553817150": "...",
        "108799766553817151": "De qualquer forma, tenha cuidado por aí. Essa ilha me passa uma vibe meio estranha. Então vou continuar fuçando, tá?",
        "108799766553817152": "Ah, e como eu sei que você está começando do zero por aí, fique com esse teledepósito da refinaria. Vai facilitar as coisas para você. Vou pendurar na tua conta. A gente se vê, cara de pavê.",
        "108799766553817153": "Ei, Bia, sabe esses drones que você tem encontrado por toda a ilha?... Tem alguma coisa estranha com eles.",
        "108799766553817154": "Hã?",
        "108799766553817155": "Ei, eu tenho mesmo olhos no céu e vou continuar a usá-los. Também estou preparando um time de drones para ir até aí e examinar as coisas de um jeito mais prático, mas isso não importa...",
        "108799766553817156": "De qualquer forma, esses drones parecem super avançados, quase alienígenas. Então eu pensei: tá, pode ter alguns alienígenas por aí explorando a Ilha Arco-Íris assim como você. Mas não, acho que não.",
        "108799766553817157": "Até porque se parece muito com os drones que usamos... mas de um jeito estranhamente familiar para mim. Quase como se estivesse tendo um déjà vu. É meio assustador!",
        "108799766553817158": "Ei, não tenha medo. Provavelmente são apenas alienígenas. Alienígenas gigantes de três cabeças com garras enormes procurados por humanos para capturar, ou comer, ou AMBOS.",
        "108799766553817159": "Muahahaha!",
        "108799766553817160": "Até depois, Bia.",
        "108799766553817161": "Bia! Estava ansiosa para falar com você. Analisei um dos drones que você encontrou pela ilha e descobri por que me parecem tão familiares: são meus.",
        "108799766553817162": "Ou pelo menos, descobri que já os vi antes... nos meus sonhos, pelo menos.",
        "108799766553817163": "Depois que examinei as análises que fiz, eu percebi o quanto eram familiares e comecei a olhar alguns dos meus antigos diários científicos. Esses diários são basicamente projetos futuros, mas às vezes contêm alguma especulação tecnológica.",
        "108799766553817164": "Você me conhece, sabe que estou sempre seis passos à frente pensando em como manter a Mochi Tech na liderança do segmento. Bem, às vezes eu tenho ideias impossíveis, que talvez nunca consiga concretizar na vida.",
        "108799766553817165": "Então, esses drones que você está encontrando são exatamente isso: impossíveis com a tecnologia de hoje e tirados diretamente das páginas dos meus diários. Eles são algo que eu vi em um sonho, Bia!",
        "108799766553817166": "Então, como um monte de drones impossíveis que eu projetei em um sonho saíram das páginas dos meus diários e foram parar na Ilha Arco-Íris?",
        "108799766553817167": "...",
        "108799766553817168": "Talvez... talvez haja algum tipo de informação arquivada neles que possamos desbloquear para saber mais. Eu sei que eles possuem registros de dados, mas se fosse eu... bem, eu sempre encontro uma maneira de esconder o que preciso...",
        "108799766553817169": "Ok, Bia, eu preciso de um tempo para pensar nisso. Te aviso se descobrir alguma coisa. Acho que vou dormir pensando...",
        "108799766553817170": "Ei, Bia, pensei em algo que você pode tentar, mas, para ser honesta, eu vou ficar super assustada se funcionar.",
        "108799766553817171": "Eu projetei o diagrama de uma chave. Uma chave de arquivo especial para os drones que você está encontrando. Se houver algum dado arquivado neles, deve ser possível acessá-los dessa maneira.",
        "108799766553817172": "Eu digo “deve” porque, na verdade, não faço ideia. Mas se esses drones saíram mesmo das páginas dos meus próprios diários... bem, essa chave é o que eu usaria para acessar os arquivos, se construísse algo como eles.",
        "108799766553817173": "Eu sei que isso não faz muito sentido, mas eu preciso que você tente. Se funcionar e existir um arquivo que, de alguma forma, permita que você entenda melhor o que acontece nessa ilha...",
        "108799766558011392": "...bem, ficarei feliz por ajudar. Eu meio que ainda te devo uma, né?",
        "108799766558011393": "Aff. Finja que eu não disse isso! Basta criar a chave idiota e, por enquanto, não me dizer se funciona ou não.",
        "108799766558011394": "Porque se funcionar... realmente não sei se estou pronta para lidar com isso.",
        "108799766558011395": "A gente se vê, cara de pavê. E boa sorte.",
        "108799766558011396": "Ei, Bia, encontrei uma coisa que ia jogar fora, mas pensei — ei, a Bia gosta dos lixos velhos que não preciso mais. Aposto que vai adorar isso.",
        "108799766558011397": "Você pode me agradecer depois.",
        "108799766558011398": "Olá, Beatrix! Adivinha quem é a pessoa mais sortuda da galáxia?",
        "108799766558011399": "VOCÊ! Porque está recebendo um presente da primeira e única, MOCHI MILES!",
        "108799766558011400": "Vou te dar um tempo para pensar. Pode se sentar, se precisar.",
        "108799766558011401": "Ei, Bia, você não disse uma vez que queria mais coisas?",
        "108799766558011402": "Hmmm... pera, acho que essa fui eu.",
        "108799766558011403": "Bem, tanto faz, divirta-se com isso.",
        "108799766558011404": "Ei, Bia, eu te dei um presente porque... sei lá. De qualquer jeito, espero que goste.",
        "108799766558011405": "Ou não... tanto faz.",
        "108799766558011406": "Fala, Bia! Tenho um pequeno presente para você, ênfase no pequeno.",
        "108799766558011407": "Porque para mim, eu consegui algo GRANDE. É muito melhor.",
        "108799766558011408": "Desculpe, Bia, não posso falar agora. Estou super ocupada com algumas coisas realmente importantes.",
        "108799766558011409": "Do tipo muito mais importante do que você, desculpe. Não tenho tempo agora para ouvir como estão as coisas.",
        "108799766558011410": "Mas isso é bom, não é?",
        "108799766558011411": "Desculpe, Bia, estou atrasada para uma reunião... Ah! A propósito, como está meu cabelo? Brincadeira, eu sei que está sempre perfeito. Tenho que correr. Então, tchau!!",
        "108799766558011412": "Ah, você vai se arrepender de um dia ter cruzado com Mochi Miles, espere só até...",
        "108799766558011413": "Ah, Bia! Desculpe! Achei que era a outra linha. Estou, bem, apenas resolvendo algumas coisas com um dos meus concorrentes. Apenas um bate-papo amigável.",
        "108799766558011414": "Olá, Beatrix! Você está aí? Sou eu, Ogden Ortiz!",
        "108799766558011415": "Ouvi dizer que você está vivendo uma grande nova aventura em uma ilha misteriosa cheia de segredos e perigos e talvez algumas frutas e legumes suculentos nunca vistos antes...?",
        "108799766558011416": "Você sabe que eu tinha que perguntar! Desde que você me conseguiu um suprimento constante de frutas kukadoba, tenho feito criações culinárias sem igual na Borda Muito Distante!",
        "108799766558011417": "...mas estou ficando muuuito cansado de comer torta de kukadoba, suflê de kukadoba, pudim de kukadoba, kukadoba com carne, kukadoba com... kukadoba.",
        "108799766558011418": "Estou ficando sem ideias... e sem força de vontade.",
        "108799766558011419": "Então, se você vir algo novo, por favor me conte. Delícias à parte, quero saber tudo o que você descobrir sobre a flora e fauna daí.",
        "108799766558011420": "Não se esqueça: cada pedacinho deste mundo selvagem é precioso e merece nosso cuidado e respeito.",
        "108799766558011421": "E não deixe de se hidratar! Toda essa agitação vai te fazer suar, então pegue esta torneira portátil.",
        "108799766558011422": "Boa sorte, Beatrix. Mantenha-me informado. Estou torcendo por você!",
        "108799766558011423": "Beatrix! Que bom que você ligou.",
        "108799766558011424": "Dei uma olhada nas fotos da Ilha Arco-Íris que você me enviou. Sem dúvida, elas são espetaculares! Lindas, de um colorido que fica cada vez mais impressionante quanto mais se olha...",
        "108799766558011425": "... mas antinatural também. Sinto muito, mas alguma coisa não está muito certa nesse lugar.",
        "108799766558011426": "Como você deve se lembrar, eu já fui o presidente de uma corporação de comida instantânea de muito sucesso. Alimentos geneticamente modificados eram nossa especialidade.",
        "108799766558011427": "Não sinto orgulho do que fizemos para alterar os alimentos naturais de modo que crescessem mais, mais rápido e mais barato: tirar os nutrientes para ter mais lucros.",
        "108799766558011428": "Digo isso, Beatrix, porque ainda consigo reconhecer uma planta alterada artificialmente quando a vejo. E os lindos arco-íris que você vê nessa ilha não apareceram naturalmente.",
        "108799766558011429": "Não está claro ainda se isso significa que você esteja correndo algum tipo de perigo, mas me dá uma sensação desconfortável no estômago. Preciso pesquisar mais e voltamos a falar.",
        "108799766558011430": "Te cuida, amiga.",
        "108799766558011431": "UUAAAAAAAAHHHHH",
        "108799766558011432": "Ai, foi mal, Beatrix! Tenho ficado lendo até tarde da noite ultimamente.",
        "108799766558011433": "Especificamente, estive lendo todos os guias de campo e trabalhos de pesquisa botânica que pude desenterrar aqui na Borda Muito Distante.",
        "108799766558011434": "Achei que mesmo que a flora da Ilha Arco-Íris não seja natural, talvez houvesse registros sobre isso em algum lugar, com alguma informação que pudéssemos usar.",
        "108799766558011435": "A verdade é que acabei não encontrando nada. Não consigo achar uma única menção à flora em tons de arco-íris em lugar nenhum. Então, isso significa que o que quer que tenha feito a ilha ter essa aparência, aconteceu há relativo pouco tempo.",
        "108799766558011436": "Mas não acho necessário te dizer isso, pois você mesma já deve ter notado. As coisas que você descreveu, além de uma parte inteira da ilha dividida bem no meio em duas cores diferentes...?",
        "108799766558011437": "...isso grita \"acidente\" para mim, Beatrix.",
        "108799766558011438": "Então tome cuidado por aí. A natureza pode ser perigosa para nós, mas nada comparado com o que podemos fazer com ela.",
        "108799766558011439": "Vou continuar vasculhando minha biblioteca em busca de qualquer outra coisa que possa ajudá-la. E se eu não encontrar nada, talvez só faça uns muffins para você!",
        "108799766558011440": "De qualquer modo, te quero bem, Beatrix. Adiós!",
        "108799766558011441": "Olá, Beatrix! Bom te ver. Espero que você esteja se cuidando por aí. Tem tirado um tempo para encher a barriga antes de cada nova jornada ao desconhecido?",
        "108799766558011442": "Além disso, parece que você encontrou algum tipo de estrutura monolítica em um cantão da ilha, é isso? Então, o caldo engrossou como uma boa sopa de cenoura...",
        "108799766558011443": "Isso é meio assustador! Afinal, talvez meu palpite esteja certo e toda essa flora estranha não seja natural...",
        "108799766558011444": "Tem algo não bate, Beatrix. Todas as ruínas que descobrimos ao redor da Borda Muito Distante não pareciam ter alterado o meio ambiente de forma alguma.",
        "108799766558011445": "Claro, não sabemos o propósito delas ou quem as construiu, mas o sentimento que sempre tive foi que tinham respeito por este mundo.",
        "108799766558011446": "Mas talvez tenha acontecido por acidente. Às vezes, quando se está caminhando, você pula uma flor para não a esmagar e acaba pisando em outra.",
        "108799766558011447": "Às vezes, a única maneira das flores se manterem vivas é estando longe dos humanos.",
        "108799766558011448": "Mas nem tudo é desgraça e tristeza: A Ilha Arco-Íris parece estar prosperando, por enquanto. A natureza deve encontrar um equilíbrio, mas isso não é garantido.",
        "108799766558011449": "Ah! Olhe só isso, cá estou eu te dando sermão. Me perdoa, Beatrix. Não vou tomar mais teu tempo.",
        "108799766558011450": "Não sei o que você encontrará além dessas paredes, mas confio em você em qualquer circunstância. Eu sei que você vai fazer a coisa certa.",
        "108799766558011451": "Boa sorte, Beatrix.",
        "108799766558011452": "Oi, amiga! Te mandei um presentinho. Não é caseiro, não é torta, e não é torta caseira...",
        "108799766558011453": "...mas achei que você ia gostar do mesmo jeito. Pena que não é uma torta...",
        "108799766558011454": "Olá, Bia! Comprei algo para você que deve te ser bem útil.",
        "108799766558011455": "Mas se você já tiver um, não tem como trocar, então... quanto mais melhor, certo?",
        "108799766558011456": "Ei, Bia, eu tenho algo especial para você! Me pareceu perfeito na hora que vi...",
        "108799766558011457": "Mas agora não estou tão certo. Buenas, se não for, não me diga, por favor. Eu não suportaria ouvir isso!",
        "108799766558011458": "Bia, se há uma coisa que sei sobre o tipo de vida de exploradora solitária que você está levando, é que nunca é ruim lembrar que seus amigos pensam em você.",
        "108799766558011459": "Então aqui vai um lembrete ...em forma de presente! Espero que te faça lembrar de mim, e de todos os bons momentos que vivemos juntos. Tchau, tchau, Bia!",
        "108799766558011460": "Amiga! Como estão as coisas por aí? Quando me sinto solitário, saio e faço algo de bom para um amigo. Isso sempre me faz muito bem!",
        "108799766558011461": "Esse é apenas meu jeito simples de dizer que estou pensando em você.",
        "108799766558011462": "Desculpe, Bia, sem tempo para conversar! Todas as minhas gagalinhas fugiram do galinheiro! Está uma confusão de penas voando por aqui! Se eu não responder até amanhã, elas me venceram.",
        "108799766558011463": "Sinto muito, Bia, mas estou prestes a tirar um suflê muito grande do forno e isso exige concentração máxima.",
        "108799766558011464": "Depois disso, vou comer um suflê muito grande e isso exigirá concentração máxima.",
        "108799766558011465": "Ei, amiga, não posso falar agora, tenho muitas preocupações no momento. Especificamente, se essa salada de cebolas-bizarras está estragada ou não.",
        "108799766558011466": "Depois de comer tantas cenouras, eu é que não vou dar mole!",
        "108799766558011467": "Ora, ora, se não é Beatrix LeBeau! O Velho Hobby e eu estávamos mesmo falando de você. Dizem que você partiu com sede de novas aventuras para partes desconhecidas deste nosso mundão?",
        "108799766558011468": "Boa menina! Sempre correndo atrás de novas maravilhas até gastar as solas das botas. Então arranje botas novas e não desista!",
        "108799766558011469": "Já eu, bem, minhas botas já viram dias melhores, mas sei que ainda permitem uma ou duas aventuras. Só preciso descobrir quais...",
        "108799766558011470": "Ah, estou divagando como o Hobson faz quando começa a falar sobre explorações, cosmos, cozinha, ou praticamente qualquer outro assunto.",
        "108799766558011471": "Tudo bem, Bia, aguenta firme aí. Vou continuar ligando para saber como você está. Não importa quem somos, todos sentimos o mesmo quando o lar está logo ali, além do horizonte.",
        "108799766558011472": "Ah, e antes que eu esqueça, aqui está uma coisinha para você enfeitar a sua casa nova. Não é muito, mas deve ajudar a tornar o lugar mais aconchegante.",
        "108799766558011473": "Oi, Bia! Como está a vida na Ilha Arco-Íris? Puxa, até falar o nome é divertido. Deve ser um espetáculo!",
        "108799766558011474": "Você sabe, né? Desde que soube que você estava aprontando outra novidade, eu comecei a refletir sobre a minha própria vida e qual seria minha próxima 'novidade'.",
        "108799766558011475": "Hobson e eu fizemos e vimos muita coisa durante nossas vidas. Pulamos de uma aventura para outra por todo lado desta rocha empoeirada. E desde que nos conhecemos, não diminuímos o ritmo nem um pouco.",
        "108799766558011476": "Então, estamos procurando uma nova aventura, juntos. Mas simplesmente não conseguimos pensar em quê ou aonde.",
        "108799766558011477": "Talvez iremos explorar algum recanto escondido da Borda Muito Distante como você, ou até mesmo mirar nas estrelas como Hobson fez antes.",
        "108799766558011478": "O que quer que decidamos fazer, será ainda mais especial porque desta vez temos um ao outro. É essa parte que torna tudo mais excitante!",
        "108799766558011479": "É tão difícil encontrar alguém neste mundo que combine completamente com a gente, uma coisa tão rara. É como encontrar dois flocos de neve idênticos no deserto.",
        "108799766558011480": "... Eu sei que você sente isso melhor do que eu sou capaz de expressar.",
        "108799766558011481": "Eu nunca vou perder a noção do quão sortuda eu sou, Bia. Eu quero aproveitar os presentes que o universo achou por bem me dar.",
        "108799766558011482": "...",
        "108799766558011483": "Levanta a cabeça, garota! Falamos de novo em breve.",
        "108799766558011484": "Ah, Bia, que bom que você atendeu. Tenho uma grande novidade que quero compartilhar e a verdade é que não há muita gente nesse pedaço de rocha disposta a me ouvir.",
        "108799766558011485": "Hobson e eu temos pensado muito sobre a nova aventura que nos espera. Estamos lendo os diários de viagem um do outro tentando encontrar lugares em que nenhum de nós esteve.",
        "108799766558011486": "Mas mesmo que tenhamos encontrado alguns, nenhum deles realmente nos motivou. Talvez estejamos finalmente perdendo o entusiasmo?",
        "108799766558011487": "Então começamos a conversar e percebemos que o que amamos mais do que tudo agora é simplesmente estar aqui no meu rancho, um perto do outro.",
        "108799766558011488": "Este rancho foi um dos primeiros da Borda Muito Distante, e nós dois aprendemos tanto... então começamos a falar sobre talvez passar tudo isso para alguém...",
        "108799766558011489": "... então Hobson e eu decidimos começar uma família, Bia. E, pela primeira vez em muito tempo, estou apavorada!",
        "108799766558011490": "Hobson e eu somos tão independentes que não sabemos nada sobre paternidade, muito menos como criar uma criança na Borda Muito Distante.",
        "108799766558011491": "Mas eu amo aquele velho ranzinza e o pensamento de ver um pequeno olhando para mim com os mesmos olhos dele me faz sorrir...",
        "108799766558011492": "Acho que isso basta para eu querer mover mundos e fundos para fazer isso acontecer.",
        "108799766558011493": "Então, eu tenho muito trabalho a fazer aqui. Tanta coisa para colocar em ordem!",
        "108799766558011494": "Obrigado por me ouvir, Bia. Às vezes, apenas compartilhar os medos com alguém nos faz perceber que não estamos sozinhos com esses medos.",
        "108799766558011495": "Se cuida, Bia.",
        "108799766558011496": "Oi, Bia, como vão as explorações? Dizem que você está até as orelhas de mistérios por aí. Soa tão emocionante!",
        "108799766558011497": "Estou aqui me perguntando por que coisas para bebê são tão desnecessariamente complicadas! Já escalei montanhas que foram mais fáceis do que montar um berço com essa pequena chave allen que eles te dão...",
        "108799766558011498": "De qualquer forma, Hobson e eu queríamos te agradecer. Acho que não teríamos percebido que queríamos um filho se você não tivesse aparecido em nossas vidas.",
        "108799766558011499": "Eu sempre vi um pouco de mim em você e, depois que você restaurou o rancho empoeirado do Hobson, percebemos que não apenas as marcas que deixamos neste mundo importam, mas que é o máximo ver como os mais jovens são capazes de transformar tudo aquilo em algo novo.",
        "108799766558011500": "Vai ser um prazer ver como nosso pequeno vai lidar com este rancho, ou qualquer outra coisa que anime seu coração.",
        "108799766558011501": "Portanto, muito obrigada, Bia. Hobson e eu somos felizes por você fazer parte de nossas vidas. Eu te desejo tudo de melhor, sempre.",

        "108799766558011503": "O Hobson queria saber por que você decidiu não usar aquele velho dispositivo nas ruínas do Deserto de Vidro para sair em uma grande aventura pelo cosmos?",
        "108799766558011504": "Eu disse a ele, Hobson Twillgers, que a decisão de uma mulher sobre viajar pelo espaço-tempo é dela e só dela, mas ele é teimoso e curioso demais.",
        "108799766558011505": "... hã?",
        "108799766558011506": "Estava quebrado? Bem, isso é estranho... O Hobson disse que deixou aquela coisa pronta e funcionando antes de ir embora. Disse que deixou a porta aberta para a próxima alma aventureira que passasse por lá.",
        "108799766558011507": "Ora, ora, Beatrix LeBeau... parece que você acabou de encontrar mais um mistério.",
        "108799766558011508": "Boa sorte com isso, Bia! Talvez, quando tudo terminar, você deva escrever um livro. Seria a história de uma aventura e tanto!",
        "108799766562205696": "Olá, Bia. Eu queria te dar algo legal, então tentei fazer biscoitos para você, mas, uh, confeitaria não é exatamente minha especialidade...",
        "108799766562205697": "O Hobson disse que ficaram muito, muito... comestíveis.",
        "108799766562205698": "...de qualquer modo, eu comprei uma coisa para você em vez disso. Espero que você goste!",
        "108799766562205699": "Sabe, Bia, dizem que os melhores presentes vêm do coração.",
        "108799766562205700": "Este veio de uma loja... mas é quase a mesma coisa, não é?",
        "108799766562205701": "Ei, Bia, eu sei que é bobagem, mas eu me preocupo com você dando duro sozinha por aí...",
        "108799766562205702": "Então, te enviei um pequeno agrado. Espero que lhe dê um pouco mais de ânimo quando for preciso!",
        "108799766562205703": "Kkkkkk, não se preocupe, eu digo a ela! Agora, pera aí, estou falando com ela!",
        "108799766562205704": "Ei, Bia, o Hobson queria que você ficasse com isso... ele diz que se você não quiser, serve também como lenha para uma fogueira!",
        "108799766562205705": "Sempre fico feliz em receber notícias suas, mas agora tenho que ir buscar Hobson: o trator quebrou novamente lá no campo. Vou dizer a ele que você mandou lembranças!",
        "108799766562205706": "Bia, receio não poder conversar agora. Uma tempestade está chegando, e tem esse bule de café que estou preparando também. Ambos exigem minha máxima atenção. Tenho que ir!",
        "108799766562205707": "Desculpe Bia, preciso manter esta linha livre para o Hobson. Ele tem um amigo com quem ele gosta de papear o dia todo sobre quem sabe o quê. Um cara estranho que veste sempre um sobretudo. Eu não entendo nada.",

        "434144879774953472": "Eu estava em um quarto com luzes estranhas e as coisas ficaram bem loucas.",
        "434144880240521216": "Eu vou voltar a explorar.",
        "434144880701894656": "Sim, você ainda está dentro do Labirinto, acredite ou não. É uma recriação total de aspectos do ambiente lá de fora, inclusive da atmosfera.",
        "434144881163268096": "Mas o que mais choca é o tamanho. É maior por dentro do que por fora. Bagunça a mente de qualquer um!",
        "434144881654001664": "Nem tudo vai fazer sentido imediatamente... talvez não fala nunca. Então dê seu melhor: explore, colete e descubra a melhor forma de navegar esse lugar.",
        "434144882119569408": "Saber como andar por aqui e entender como as coisas funcionam vai se mostrar importante depois de um tempo.",
        "434144882580942848": "Quando partes do Labirinto começarem a brilhar e explodir com uma luz radiante, você precisa tomar cuidado.",
        "434144883059093504": "Eu as chamo de Anomalias Prismáticas. Elas são as explosões instáveis de energia geradas pelo Núcleo Prismático. Elas vêm em ondas, portanto, aprenda a identificá-las e a sobreviver a elas.",
        "434144883512078336": "Porque ainda que as anomalias sejam perigosas, você vai ver que são essenciais para o nosso trabalho aqui... com o tempo.",
        "434144883965063168": "Certo, Beatrix, se precisar de mim, sabe onde me encontrar... mais ou menos.",
        "434160849277054976": "Você já viu o pôr do sol dentro do Labirinto? A escuridão da noite invade e, ainda assim, é tudo uma ilusão. Ou, pelo menos, tem que ser...",
        "434160851747500032": "Falando de escuridão, o que são aquelas slimes obscuras que eu tenho visto?",
        "434160852200484864": "Por que você confiou em mim com tudo isso, Gigi?",
        "434160852657664000": "É melhor eu continuar.",
        "434160853140008960": "Os Slimes Sombrosos são uma estranha variante de slimes que parecem ser a polaridade oposta do Núcleo Prismático manifestada.",
        "434160853597188096": "Ainda não sei se eles foram criados especificamente por alguém para ser esse tipo de força opositora ou se evoluíram para ser assim. Sabe aquilo de a natureza sempre encontrar uma maneira?",
        "434160854066950144": "De qualquer forma, os plorts sombrosos parecem fornecer um tipo de efeito para abafar as Anomalias Prismáticas. É uma hipótese remota, mas talvez elas possam ser usadas de alguma forma para negar os efeitos do Núcleo Prismático.",
        "434160854532517888": "Tem alguma dica sobre Slimes Sombrosos?",
        "434160855006474240": "Eles são chatinhos, não são? Os slimes sombrosos fogem de você ou de anomalias prismáticas. Portanto, o melhor a fazer é procurar áreas que não tenham sofrido recentemente os efeitos de uma anomalia.",
        "434160855480430592": "Quando vir um grupo deles, você precisará se aproximar sorrateiramente e tentar acertar o maior número possível de plorts antes que todos fujam. Portanto, não se esqueça de levar um pouco mais de lixo no seu vacpack.",
        "434160855937609728": "Só não vai sair correndo atrás de um e acabar caindo em algum lugar. Não que isso já tenha acontecido comigo... hehe.",
        "434160856415760384": "Eu não sou uma heroína, Beatrix. Eu sabia que precisaria de uma heroína de verdade para impedir o que estava acontecendo aqui.",
        "434160856881328128": "E... uma heroína é alguém em quem você pode confiar. Se não for você, quem pode ser? Então tentei imaginar a pessoa perfeita para esse trabalho e era você.",
        "434160857334312960": "Já quebraram minha confiança antes. Foi isso que fez tudo dar errado. Eu confiei nas pessoas erradas. Mas essa é a minha chance de fazer tudo dar certo.",
        "434160857791492096": "Você pode não ver isso ainda, mas você é uma heroína, Beatrix. Vai se tornar uma com o tempo. Tem tantas aventuras incríveis no seu caminho, eu prometo.",
        "434160858261254144": "Com o tempo, isso vai ser só mais um capítulo nas Aventuras de Beatrix LeBeau. Outra história para alguma garotinha ler embaixo de uma árvore e sonhar acordada, imaginando se a vida dela pode ser tão grandiosa assim...",
        "434160858726821888": "Fico feliz de esclarecer o que você quiser, quando precisar.",
        "434166468247711744": "É tão fácil se perder em pensamentos, admirando essa arquitetura estranha e imaginando de onde vem tudo isso, não é?",
        "434166470726545408": "Quem você acha que construiu esse lugar?",
        "434166471175335936": "E você, Gigi? De onde você é?",
        "434166471632515072": "Acho que é hora de eu ir.",
        "434166472085499904": "Há muitas evidências em toda a Borda Muito Distante de que alguém ou alguma coisa esteve aqui há muito tempo. Há ruínas e restos de dispositivos tecnológicos antigos em todo o planeta.",
        "434166472546873344": "Essas ruínas sempre foram intrigantes porque não parecem ter funções específicas, pelo menos nada que possamos entender. Sem mencionar todas as estátuas de slime que vemos por toda parte!",
        "434166473004052480": "Mas o Labirinto é diferente. Acredito que foi construído com um propósito específico em mente.",
        "434166473478008832": "E qual seria ele?",
        "434166473964548096": "Acho que o Núcleo Prismático foi descoberto há muito tempo e esse Labirinto é uma instalação de contenção e pesquisa que foi construída em torno dele.",
        "434166474417532928": "Não conseguiram parar os efeitos do Núcleo Prismático, então tentaram evitar que ele afetasse o resto da Borda Muito Distante enquanto procuravam uma solução.",
        "434166474862129152": "O Labirinto foi projetado para ser um ecossistema autossustentável. Acho que isso foi feito para simular partes da Ilha Arco-Íris e ver o que o Núcleo Prismático faria com ela ao longo do tempo.",
        "434166475315113984": "Fora do Labirinto, você viu, em maior parte, mudanças cromáticas no mundo, mas dentro dele, onde os efeitos são amplificados, as propriedades elementares mudarão completamente.",
        "434166475772293120": "Vamos achar uma forma de impedir isso.",
        "434166476250443776": "Com o tempo, espero que sim. Com o tempo...",
        "434166476711817216": "Uma pergunta difícil de responder, eu acho. Na verdade, sou de um lugar não muito distante de onde você agora chama de lar. Mas nunca teríamos nos cruzado antes.",
        "434166477168996352": "Eu nasci na Borda Muito Distante. É o meu lar e é o único lugar que eu conheço fora dos livros.",
        "434166477621981184": "Por isso, quando descobri a Ilha Arco-Íris, senti que era algo genuinamente novo, como encontrar um cômodo secreto na casa de sua infância. Eu queria ficar lá para sempre.",
        "434166478079160320": "Mas agora parece que já vivi muitas vidas. Minha infância foi uma delas, e minha vida na Ilha Arco-Íris, outra. E agora que estou de volta, bom, suponho que essa seja outra vida. Mas está ficando confuso.",
        "434166478590865408": "Como assim?",
        "434166479039655936": "A maneira como consegui voltar, para ter outra chance de consertar o que está acontecendo aqui... bom, não foi a maneira típica de viajar. Por isso, agora minha cabeça está sempre um pouco nebulosa, um pouco confusa.",
        "434166479530389504": "As lembranças que eu tenho agora parecem bagunçadas, como se estivessem fora de ordem. Às vezes, o que fiz ontem parece tão distante, como se fosse uma memória de infância...",
        "434166479983374336": "... e, de repente, algumas memórias de infância de verdade são tão claras que parecem ser recentes.",
        "434166480478302208": "Minha lembrança mais antiga sempre foi a de estar sentada embaixo da mesa da sala de jantar e observar minha mãe aspirar a sala de estar. Ela não sabia que eu estava lá e eu apenas a observava.",
        "434166480927092736": "Lembro de que era um dia quente e ela parecia cansada e chateada com alguma coisa. E era só isso.",
        "434166481380077568": "Mas desde que voltei, essa memória mudou. Eu ainda estou embaixo da mesa e ela ainda está passando aspirador de pó. O dia está quente e ela está cansada...",
        "434166481862422528": "... Mas então ela percebe que eu estou lá. E a expressão dela muda repentinamente para surpresa e alegria e ela para o que está fazendo.",
        "434166482319601664": "Ela se ajoelha e conversamos sobre algo, mas não consigo ouvir minhas próprias palavras. Apenas a vejo ouvindo e sorrindo.",
        "434166482772586496": "Boa exploração!",
        "434169717507911680": "Que vista incrível... é tão fácil se perder nessa beleza toda. Bom, até uma Anomalia Prismática transformar tudo em um grande caos.",
        "434169719974162432": "É, já é difícil não se perder sem as anomalias.",
        "434169720464896000": "Achei que esse fosse ser o caso, então desenvolvi um artefato que vai ser útil para você.",
        "434169720938852352": "O nome é Detector de Anomalias e é autoexplicativo: colocar esse artefato pelo Labirinto vai te dizer quando uma Anomalia Prismática está para acontecer naquela área. Funciona até mesmo no seu mapa!",
        "434169721408614400": "Vou te dar um que eu mesma fiz e o diagrama para você poder fabricar quantos precisar.",
        "434169721878376448": "Como eu uso o Detector de Anomalias mesmo?",
        "434169722331361280": "Como eu consigo Plorts Prismáticos?",
        "434169722817900544": "Preciso continuar.",
        "434169723275079680": "Não se preocupe, eu fico meio confusa mesmo às vezes. É parte dos efeitos colaterais de... bom...",
        "434169723770007552": "De qualquer forma, usar um Detector de Anomalias é fácil. Basta fabricar um e colocá-lo em qualquer lugar do Labirinto onde você queira rastrear as Anomalias Prismáticas.",
        "434169724218798080": "Quando colocado, o Detector de Anomalias vai te avisar se uma Anomalia Prismática está prestes a acontecer ou acontecendo atualmente naquela área.",
        "434169724671782912": "Os Plorts Prismáticos podem ser adquiridos nas Anomalias Prismáticas que ocorrem em todo o Labirinto. As Anomalias Prismáticas farão com que as áreas brilhem repentinamente com energia prismática, intensificando-se com o tempo.",
        "434169725158322176": "Durante essas anomalias, você pode encontrar alimentos no chão que se tornaram instáveis devido aos efeitos do Núcleo Prismático. Se você alimentar os slimes com isso, eles produzirão um Plort instável.",
        "434169725653250048": "Plorts instáveis? Como eu estabilizo eles?",
        "434169726093651968": "Plorts Instáveis podem ser estabilizados em Plorts Prismáticos usando estabilizadores que você encontrará no Labirinto. Com base nas minhas descobertas, eles vêm em duas formas.",
        "434169726567608320": "Uma delas são os Estabilizadores Antigos: dispositivos grandes e em formato de aro que você vai encontrar pelo Labirinto. São fáceis de encontrar.",
        "434169727016398848": "Há também os Estabilizadores Temporais etéreos que aparecem aleatoriamente como pequenos aros dourados de energia durante as Anomalias Prismáticas. As anomalias são caóticas, portanto, preste bastante atenção.",
        "434169727490355200": "Em todo caso, atirar Plorts instáveis por esses aros vai gerar Plorts Prismáticos. E com Estabilizadores Antigos você pode até mesmo saltar através dos aros para estabilizar todos os seus plorts de uma vez.",
        "434169727981088768": "Boa exploração!",
        "434189984019935232": "Você é muito boa em encontrar segredos, pelo que parece. Eu levei eras para encontrar esse lugar.",
        "434189987203411968": "Segredos parecem ser a base desse lugar.",
        "434189987656396800": "Falando em segredos, por que você fingiu ser uma inteligência artificial?",
        "434189988105187328": "Vamos para o próximo segredo...",
        "434189988549783552": "É o que parece. Suspeito que parte do formato estranho se deve ao fato de o Labirinto ter sido construído ao longo do tempo. E, eventualmente, soluções mais criativas tiveram que ser desenvolvidas para torná-lo ainda maior do que poderia ser.",
        "434189989002768384": "Soluções criativas?",
        "434189989472530432": "Sabe como o Labirinto parece maior por dentro do que por fora? Acho que isso foi, de alguma forma, uma tecnologia adaptada do próprio Núcleo Prismático.",
        "434189989963264000": "Porque, embora isso pareça loucura, a energia do Núcleo Prismático em sua forma mais concentrada parece ser capaz de alterar a realidade.",
        "434189990416248832": "Acho que o Labirinto acabou sendo expandido para tentar conter toda a energia do Núcleo Prismático e, quando isso não funcionou, foi usado algum tipo de tecnologia de alteração da realidade para torná-lo ainda maior.",
        "434189990873427968": "Mas, em algum momento, tudo começou a falhar. E a energia do Núcleo Prismático agora está se irradiando por toda a Ilha Arco-Íris.",
        "434189991326412800": "Desculpe, mas eu tinha que ter certeza de que podia confiar no Viktor e precisava saber que ele poderia descobrir o que eu não conseguia. As portas do Labirinto estavam trancadas para você, mas não para mim. Pelo menos, não mais.",
        "434189991829729280": "Quando encontrei o Núcleo Prismático pela primeira vez, antes de chegar aqui, quando a catástrofe aconteceu... isso me deixou marcada de certa forma. Tentei me proteger da explosão. Sobrevivi, mas algo estava diferente.",
        "434189992282714112": "Parte da assinatura de energia do Núcleo Prismático agora faz parte de mim. É por isso que não posso me aproximar muito dele e preciso que você me ajude.",
        "434189992735698944": "Portanto, você precisa entender que eu simplesmente não poderia permitir que tudo acontecesse de novo. Se eu entregasse as chaves desse lugar para a pessoa errada...Você terá que confiar em mim, pois essa é a nossa última chance.",
        "434189993218043904": "Para mim, não há como voltar atrás.",
        "434189993696194560": "Se tem alguém que pode fazer isso, é você, Beatrix.",
        "434192420939919360": "Eu chamo esse lugar de Terra dos Sonhos. Eu costumava subir até aqui e passar as horas entre as nuvens. É um lugar agradável para esquecer dos problemas.",
        "434192423401975808": "É aqui que o Labirinto gera a atmosfera dele?",
        "434192423859154944": "Você tem algum sonho, Gigi?",
        "434192424307945472": "Acho que é hora de explorar essa Terra dos Sonhos.",
        "434192424760930304": "Acho que sim, talvez até mais. Há algo diferente no ar aqui. É difícil de explicar. Mas parece quase como se as nuvens e até mesmo as ilhas em que você está agora fossem formadas a partir do éter ao seu redor.",
        "434192425192943616": "Não construídas ou montadas, mas reunidos a partir de pequenas coisas no ar. Passei muito tempo nessas ilhas e, às vezes, juro que comecei a sentir um tipo de fluxo. Como se eu estivesse ganhando controle sobre elas.",
        "434192425650122752": "Um dia, eu estava sentada aqui, sentindo saudades de casa, e pensava em como, quando era pequena, eu ficava no jardim da minha mãe à noite e começava a sentir o cheiro do jantar sendo preparado em nossa casa.",
        "434192426132467712": "Eu costumava me deliciar vendo os vegetais crescendo bem na minha frente e sentindo os aromas dos pratos cozidos. Parecia que as coisas estavam conectadas de alguma forma.",
        "434192426606424064": "E enquanto estava sentada aqui, fechei os olhos tentando imaginar aquele jardim novamente e, naquele momento, juro que senti o cheiro do jantar sendo preparado.",
        "434192427101351936": "Quando abri os olhos, havia uma nova ilha à distância, à minha frente, e nela estava a casa em que eu cresci. Mas ela estava lá apenas por um momento antes de desaparecer nas nuvens...",
        "434192427579502592": "Eu costumava ter muitos sonhos. Queria me libertar das expectativas que meus pais tinham para mim. Queria estar no comando do meu próprio caminho. Então, eu sonhava em fugir e me tornar quem eu quisesse ser.",
        "434192428028293120": "Eu sonhava que um dia eles veriam a pessoa que eu me tornei e ficariam muito felizes por mim. E tudo ficaria bem de alguma forma. Não importaria o fato de eu tê-los deixado para trás.",
        "434192428472889344": "Mas quando somos jovens, às vezes não vemos como as coisas estão quebradas bem na nossa frente. A nossa versão do mundo é como um espelho de banheiro embaçado. Vemos a forma das coisas, mas não os detalhes.",
        "434192428925874176": "Agora eu sei que a minha mãe nunca superou o falecimento da minha avó. Não percebi a pressão que ela sentiu para continuar seu legado e a tristeza que fazia parte da vida dela... só entendi muito depois de eu ter ido embora.",
        "434192429374664704": "Agora sonho que um dia vou voltar para casa e que, de alguma forma, meus pais entenderão por que eu tive de partir. Acho que é sempre isso que acontece... a gente só quer que eles nos entendam.",
        "434192429836038144": "Cuidado por aí. Sonhos podem acabar num piscar de olhos.",
        "434196761864204288": "Oi, Beatrix. Parece que você não se perdeu no sonho ainda.",
        "434196764397563904": "Tudo aqui parece estar ficando dourado...",
        "434196764867325952": "Você se sente perdida, Gigi?",
        "434196765337088000": "Sim, por causa da proximidade da Terra dos Sonhos com o Núcleo Prismático, você está vendo alguns dos piores efeitos dele.",
        "434196765790072832": "Aqui eu vi a água se transformar em vidro, as árvores em metal e estruturas inteiras ao redor do Núcleo Prismático se tornarem quase invisíveis antes de desaparecerem completamente, como se tivessem deixado de existir.",
        "434196766251446272": "Pouco a pouco, toda a Terra dos Sonhos se transformará em ouro, a menos que a gente faça alguma coisa. O lugar onde você está ficará pesado e cairá do céu. Com o tempo, a atmosfera gerada aqui entrará em colapso e desestabilizará ainda mais o Labirinto.",
        "434196766717014016": "E quando o Labirinto cair e a energia do Núcleo Prismático se irradiar por toda a Borda Muito Distante, ele transformará esse mundo em algo irreconhecível, levando consigo toda a vida do planeta.",
        "434196767195164672": "Os slimes...",
        "434196767660732416": "Sim, nem mesmo os slimes conseguiriam sobreviver a uma catástrofe como essa. Mas não deixaremos que isso aconteça. Você e eu encontraremos uma maneira.",
        "434196768130494464": "Eu me sinto perdida o tempo todo. Mas quando viajei pelo Deserto de Vidro, foi pior ainda.",
        "434196768587673600": "Você atravessou o Deserto de Vidro?",
        "434196769053241344": "Duas vezes, acredite se quiser. E para ser sincera, quase morri...",
        "434196769531392000": "Veja bem, quando comecei a pesquisar sobre o Deserto de Vidro, descobri que o nome não era adequado a esse lugar. O que eu vi era verdejante e cheio de vida.",
        "434196769996959744": "Isso se deve a um tipo muito especial de água que flui lá e que pode cultivar quase que magicamente... Bom, veja para quem eu estou falando, você sabe bem disso.",
        "434196770475110400": "Por isso, não me preparei bem. E na minha viagem de volta... o Deserto de Vidro ganhou sua reputação.",
        "434196770932289536": "Era um deserto completamente estéril. Os ventos machucavam meu rosto e me cegavam. E toda vez que eu achava que estava segura, o mundo ao meu redor explodia em chamas.",
        "434196771376885760": "Como você conseguiu continuar?",
        "434196771855036416": "Gigi faz uma pausa por um momento e passa os farrapos da capa dela entre os dedos.",
        "434196772320604160": "Essa capa pertencia à minha avó. Bom, era o cobertor que ela costumava usar em cima das pernas quando já estava velhinha. Pelo menos foi o que eu vi nas fotos. E depois foi da minha mãe até que ela o deu para mim.",
        "434196772781977600": "Mamãe costumava costurar todos os rasgos ou desgastes no momento em que aconteciam. Tantos pontos pequenos que não combinavam muito bem... era o jeito que ela tentava manter tudo junto.",
        "434196773243351040": "Um dia, eu estava sentada no chão de uma caverna, ouvindo a tempestade lá fora. Eu estava enrolada na minha capa e chorava com o peso de tudo. Eu estava cansada e tudo parecia insuportável.",
        "434196773717307392": "E então senti minha mãe me protegendo. Olhei para todos os pontos em ziguezague que me envolviam e percebi que aqueles remendos que ela fez me mantinham sã, não importa o que eu tivesse que fazer.",
        "434196774170292224": "E talvez agora ela esteja rasgada e desgastada e nunca mais será a mesma. Mas ainda está aqui. Ela me salvou, assim como nós salvaremos esse lugar. Talvez nunca mais seja o mesmo, mas nós o manteremos unido, Beatrix.",
        "434196774627471360": "Pode continuar, Beatrix.",
        "434198584142491648": "Mal posso acreditar que você chegou até aqui, Beatrix. Esse labirinto engoliria uma pessoa normal. Mas você, você é diferente. Eu estava certa em confiar em você.",
        "434198586608742400": "O Núcleo Prismático está à frente. Talvez juntas a gente tenha uma chance de parar essa coisa e mudar o futuro da Borda Muito Distante...",
        "434198587065921536": "A conclusão da nossa história te aguarda na nossa próxima atualização de conteúdo! Enquanto isso, não deixe de explorar o Labirinto, conversar com a Gigi em todos os lugares e construir uma infraestrutura com artefatos para ajudar nas suas viagens.",
        "434198587523100672": "Agradecemos pelo seu apoio, seus comentários e pelo entusiasmo com Slime Rancher. Mal podemos esperar para que você veja o que vem por aí!",
        "434198587980279808": "Quando a próxima atualização de conteúdo será lançada?",
        "434198588420681728": "Como eu deixo Slime Rancher ainda melhor?",
        "434198588886249472": "Eu amo muito slimes. Muito mesmo.",
        "434198589339234304": "Tudo pronto! Quero continuar explorando.",
        "434198589813190656": "Você pode saber ao seguir o Slime Rancher nas mídias sociais ou se inscrevendo no nosso boletim informativo em <style=\"weblink\"><link=\"https://gsght.com/c/4l9e90\">slimerancher.com</link></style>",
        "434198590266175488": "O Slime Rancher só é possível graças ao apoio da nossa comunidade. Você pode nos apoiar deixando comentários sobre o Slime Rancher, transmitindo-o ou conversando sobre ele com outros membros da nossa comunidade.",
        "434198590719160320": "Até mesmo contar a um amigo, parente ou aquele gato particularmente influente na sua vizinhança sobre o jogo ajuda a espalhar a notícia!",
        "434198591176339456": "Os slimes também amam muito você. Muito mesmo.",
        "434627962089402368": "Já vi a água se transformar em vidro. Flores se transformarem em metal. É terrível.",
        "434627965256101888": "E então sua expressão muda novamente. Ela ainda está sorrindo e vejo que as lágrimas começam a se formar nos cantos de seus olhos, mas ela as contém.",
        "434629957986709504": "Funciona até mesmo no seu mapa, portanto, certifique-se de colocar vários e cobrir o máximo possível do Labirinto se quiser coletar muitos Plorts Prismáticos, algo que precisaremos quando você me encontrar.",
        "434629960771727360": "Bem, seria divertido se não fosse pelo fato de o mundo ao seu redor estar explodindo com energias perigosas e plorts instáveis estarem voando do seu tanque...",
        "434634062582935552": "Mas, mesmo assim, é uma aventura, né?",
        "434637451849003008": "De certa forma, minha chegada nesse lugar foi na hora certa. Na hora certa e na hora errada, e acho...",
        "434638300511891456": "... Ainda não sei se aquilo foi real ou não.",
        "434639513852735488": "Passei muitos dias encolhida em cavernas, tentando encontrar coragem para continuar. Mas eu sabia que precisava fazer isso. Tinha que voltar para a Ilha Arco-Íris e encontrar uma solução.",
        "442195192629063680": "E então ela me diz que sente muito por minha avó nunca ter tido a chance de me conhecer.",
        "442195194155790336": "Ela coloca uma mão no meu ombro e está prestes a falar outra coisa, mas a estação de comunicação toca, e ela se vira.",
        "442195194625552384": "Não me lembro de mais nada depois disso.",
        "428361726019923968": "Beatrix! Recebi outra mensagem da \"IA\" com a qual tenho me comunicado desde sua chegada à Ilha Arco-Íris.",
        "428361726045089792": "A mensagem era um pouco pessoal para mim, mas também tinha informações importantes para você, portanto, a fim de apresentar todos os dados em sua plenitude, vou lê-la literalmente...",
        "428361726045089793": "Hum!",
        "428361726045089794": "\"Viktor, agradeço você por conversar comigo durante esses muitos dias em que pude conhecê-lo melhor. Devo confessar que iniciei nossa correspondência com o objetivo de verificar sua capacidade científica.",
        "428361726045089795": "Nossa correspondência não só me garantiu isso, mas também me proporcionou conforto e companheirismo nos dias sombrios em que me encontro agora.",
        "428361726045089796": "Estou enviando um diagrama parcial de um artefato que tentei desenvolver, mas não consegui. Se você conseguir completá-lo, acredito que seja a chave para entrar no Labirinto cinzento. ",
        "428361726045089797": "Por favor, entenda que eu nunca quis enganá-lo, Viktor. Mas preciso saber em quem posso confiar para ter uma chance de consertar as coisas. Se isso acontecer, eu adoraria conhecê-lo um dia.",
        "428361726045089798": "Eu adoraria jogar outra partida de Go, tomando café, até o sol nascer novamente.\"",
        "428361726045089799": "... E isso é tudo.",
        "428361726045089800": "O que me foi entregue foi um diagrama complexo de esquemas parciais e, francamente, um código quase alienígena. Passei dias analisando ele e acredito que o modifiquei em um estado finalizado que deve executar a tarefa para a qual foi projetado.",
        "428361726045089801": "Pelo menos é o que espero. Para ser franco, não quero decepcionar essa pessoa. Sinto que devo isso a ela... como amigo.",
        "428361726045089802": "Então, deixe-me entregar o diagrama completo, de acordo com as instruções. Parece ser um dispositivo que você precisará usar perto das entradas do Labirinto. Mas infelizmente isso é tudo o que sei.",
        "428361726045089803": "Se souber como usá-lo... Bem... Experimente! Essa é a única maneira de desbravar o desconhecido.",
        "428361726045089804": "Boa sorte, Beatrix. Parece que estamos todos contando com você agora.",
        "497217680223924224": "Olá de novo! Conectei esta Estação de Troca à minha instalação, então podemos trocar as coisas que você encontrar por coisas que eu posso fabricar.",
        "497217686565711872": "E talvez, os harmonizadores...",
        "494426433331556352": "Espero muito que sim. Meu palpite é que qualquer coisa instável ou fora do lugar aqui seja resultado das ondas prismáticas que estão cobrindo o Labirinto e transmutando tudo. Se eu conseguir inventar algo que anule elas em uma área, pode ser o suficiente pra você descobrir onde os harmonizadores estão escondidos.\n",
        "494426435990745088": "Como você consegue construir algo assim?",
        "494426436984795136": "Bem, antes de mais nada, vou precisar de plorts prismáticos para criar o diagrama. Preciso fazer vários testes prismáticos para entender quais são os parâmetros.",
        "503065643299008514": "Agora, para construir... Aqueles slimes sombrosos estranhos podem ser a resposta. Os plorts deles têm um efeito natural de amortecimento nas ondas prismáticas. Talvez tenham evoluído pra isso, de algum jeito? Eles podem comprimir as ondas e...",
        "503065643299008515": "Desculpa, me empolguei aqui. Só fica de olho nos plorts sombrosos, talvez sejam úteis mais tarde. Enquanto isso, traga seus plorts prismáticos pra mim, assim eu posso começar a trabalhar no dispositivo de anulação.",
        "494426436498255872": "Entendido.",
        "503065643299008518": "Estamos chegando perto, Beatrix. Vamos até o fim.",
        "512531865044414464": "Estou contando com você pra conseguir esses plorts, assim posso desenvolver o diagrama do Anulador. É um tiro no escuro, mas precisamos manter a esperança, Beatrix.",
        "512855595578716160": "Agora que você tem o diagrama do meu artefato Anulador, vá em frente e fabrique ele na Manufatura do Solário. Depois, cabe a você começar a procurar por aquelas áreas escondidas atrás de paredes estranhas.",
        "512528636512464896": "Continue procurando por paredes estranhas. Se você usar o Anulador na frente delas, ele deve causar algum efeito e vai permitir que você passe. Com sorte, você vai encontrar os harmonizadores ali, e então podemos tentar estabilizar o Núcleo Prismático.",
        "515408179648688128": "Esta é uma mensagem gravada: Você ativou todos os harmonizadores! Por favor, venha falar comigo lá no Núcleo Prismático. Agora o trabalho de verdade começa...",
        "515407435033899008": "Mensagem gravada: Oi, Beatrix! Deixei a Estação de Troca no automático. Você pode depositar plorts prismáticos pra ganhar moedas arco-íris quando quiser. Divirta-se!",
        "459162059549601792": "Oi, Beatrix. Parece que alguns harmonizadores ainda precisam ser ativados.\r",
        "512135795118338048": "Use o Anulador para abrir caminhos escondidos no Labirinto. Tente procurar por paredes que pareçam estranhas, como se tivessem sido alteradas pelas ondas prismáticas.",
        "512137435087007744": "Incrível! Você ativou todos os harmonizadores. Estamos quase prontos pra iniciar o processo de estabilização do Núcleo Prismático.",
        "512137648556109824": "Pra isso funcionar, vamos precisar de muita água, mas parece que você não tem um tanque de água. Tente fabricar um na Manufatura no Solário e, depois, me avise quando estiver pronta.",
        "508172740122537984": "Improvisei essa ducha hídrica pra emergências, mas não tem água chegando aqui, só um monte de canos. Se conseguirmos fazer a água correr de alguma forma, ela vai ser bem útil... Confia em mim.",
        "508173982047563776": "Depois eu explico melhor.\r",
        "459162940231806976": "Vamos nessa.",
        "459163070364282880": "Preciso me preparar um pouco mais.",
        "459163407372414976": "Volte quando estiver pronta. Estarei esperando.",
        "459163883820183552": "Mais uma vez, estou contando com você, Beatrix.\r",
        "512137991872475136": "É isso, Beatrix. Com os harmonizadores ativados, e com a sua ajuda, posso tentar estabilizar o Núcleo Prismático.",
        "512152448220688384": "Beatrix! Todas as leituras do Núcleo Prismático... estão estáveis! Está em um comprimento de onda completamente diferente de antes! Eu... Eu consigo sentir.",
        "512404458169856000": "Aqui está, Beatrix... O Núcleo Prismático.\r",
        "512404595482980352": "Fiquei sem fôlego quando o vi pela primeira vez. A forma como a luz se torcia e se movia dentro dele, como mudava a cada instante... Era como olhar pro infinito. Se ao menos eu soubesse, naquela época, o que aconteceria com ele... Comigo... Com tudo.",
        "512405717933256704": "Sinto muito por ter te trazido até aqui. Por ter te envolvido nisso tudo. Mas foi o único jeito.\r",
        "512520617573642240": "E como eu estava dizendo: acho que posso inventar algo que revele áreas escondidas no Labirinto.",
        "512775262921453568": "Vai levar muito tempo pra terra se recuperar e os efeitos pararem, como as anomalias prismáticas. Mas a Ilha Arco-Íris... Não, o futuro de toda a Borda Muito Distante foi salvo. Você conseguiu, Beatrix. Nós conseguimos. E eu não tenho palavras pra agradecer.",
        "522633243620175872": "Ainda bem que você voltou. Consegui encerrar o processo e evacuar a sala a tempo. Estou realmente feliz por ter instalado aquela ducha de emergência!",
        "523379801986854912": "Oi, Beatrix. Tenho chamado essa área de Terrário.",
        "523379806806110208": "Por que “Terrário”?",
        "523379807615610880": "Para que serve essa área? Preservação?",
        "523379808395751424": "Vou entrar agora pra dar uma olhada.",
        "523379809226223616": "Bom... Sabe, um terrário é só um recipiente que mantém plantas fora do ambiente natural delas.",
        "523379810023141376": "Da primeira vez que passei por aqui, foi essa a impressão que tive. Só uma biosfera, embora muito bonita, com alimentos únicos e slimes diferentes.",
        "523379810853613568": "E... talvez isso seja verdade. É possível que essa seja uma forma de representar o mundo exterior aqui no Labirinto, de forma segura, por trás do vidro.",
        "523379811671502848": "Mas... já não tenho mais tanta certeza.",
        "523379812455837696": "E o que você acha que é, de verdade?",
        "523379813261144064": "Provavelmente é melhor eu continuar andando.",
        "523379814079033344": "Esse é o problema, Beatrix. Não tenho como saber ao certo. Mas...",
        "523379814884339712": "Tenho quase certeza de que o Labirinto inteiro é uma instalação criada pra conter e estabilizar o Núcleo Prismático. Então, logicamente, o Terrário está aqui por algum motivo relacionado a ele.",
        "523379815681257472": "E se eu pensar no que isso poderia ser...",
        "523379816478175232": "Será que é uma espécie de banco de sementes? Tipo, se as coisas dessem muito errado no futuro, se o Núcleo Prismático se tornasse instável demais e realmente se rompesse... isso seria uma forma de garantir que parte da flora sobrevivesse à calamidade que viria.",
        "523379817296064512": "Se for isso, o Terrário é basicamente, bom, uma apólice de seguro pra que, se o pior acontecer, haja uma segunda chance.",
        "523379818080399360": "É, dá pra compreender.",
        "523379818885705728": "O que exatamente você acha compreensível nisso?",
        "523379819695206400": "Vou tentar impedir que chegue a esse ponto.",
        "523379820555038720": "Bom...",
        "523379821393899520": "...",
        "523379822186622976": "C-Claro que eu quero acreditar que minhas ações no passado podem ajudar a salvar o futuro. Digo, acho que é natural querer deixar as coisas preparadas pra que o futuro seja melhor, mesmo sem ter como saber com certeza o que realmente vai ajudar.",
        "523379823033872384": "Mas...",
        "523379823839178752": "Se você pensar de outro jeito: pra todos que existem no futuro, o que está acontecendo agora já é passado. A gente quer que essas pessoas olhem pra trás, pro que estamos fazendo, e sintam que isso fez toda a diferença pra elas.",
        "523379824648679424": "Ou, melhor ainda, que elas nem precisem se preocupar com nada disso.",
        "523379825487540224": "O que fazemos aqui vai fazer toda a diferença, no fim das contas. Eu tenho que acreditar nisso.",
        "523379826301235200": "Tudo que podemos fazer é viver o agora. Vou seguir em frente.",
        "523379827114930176": "As coisas estão ruins, mas... ainda tem muito aqui pra ver e amar. Espero que você consiga aproveitar um pouco também.",
        "523380586816630784": "Oi, Beatrix. Área fascinante, né?",
        "523380587600965632": "Parece quase um tipo de museu!",
        "523380588435632128": "Não tenho tempo pra enrolar, Gigi.",
        "523380589240938496": "É isso que caixas de vidro normalmente dizem pra gente, mas eu acho que elas estão aqui por outro motivo. Na verdade, eu tenho quase certeza de que têm algo a ver com manipulação do tempo.",
        "523380590050439168": "Observei aquelas com plantas por um tempo, e percebi que o tempo passa mais rápido dentro delas do que fora.",
        "523380590868328448": "Acho que deve ser um jeito de analisar os efeitos do Núcleo Prismático no mundo natural. Talvez seja uma forma de prever o que aconteceria em caso de ruptura.",
        "523380591715577856": "Isso acontece também com os prédios pequenos?",
        "523380592537661440": "Não tenho tempo a perder.",
        "523380593342967808": "Talvez, mas não tenho certeza.",
        "523380594135691264": "Pode ser, ou talvez esteja manipulando o espaço em vez disso... ou até uma terceira coisa tão estranha pra nós que nunca vamos ter o contexto necessário pra entender.",
        "523380594928414720": "Existem tantos mistérios na Ilha Arco-Íris, Beatrix, e acho que não vamos resolver nem metade deles durante nossas vidas.",
        "523380595721138176": "Às vezes, tudo que dá pra fazer é olhar pelo vidro e imaginar o que está acontecendo do outro lado.",
        "523380596513861632": "Você sente isso com frequência?",
        "523380597340139520": "Eu sinto isso faz muito tempo, falando bem a verdade.",
        "523380598174806016": "Sabe, minha vida toda estava planejada: eu cresceria e assumiria o rancho, do mesmo jeito que a minha mãe fez com a minha avó. Um dia, eu passaria o rancho pra um filho meu. Tudo foi pensado com tanto carinho. Uma casa linda, nosso legado de família.",
        "523380598980112384": "Pra mim, era um mundo tão pequeno, como estar dentro de um desses domos aqui, com as mãos contra o vidro imaginando a vida que eu teria vivido se não tivesse nascido num rancho.",
        "523380599785418752": "Vim pra Ilha Arco-Íris tentar viver essa outra vida. Mas agora tô presa de novo, dessa vez de verdade. Irônico, né? Atrás do vidro, isolada como todo o resto aqui.",
        "523380600670416896": "Vou sair pra tentar te libertar assim que puder.",
        "523380601471528960": "Eu sei que precisamos agir rápido, mas tira um tempinho pra aproveitar o que está na sua frente também.",
        "523382731968245760": "Ah, não... Tem ouro aqui. Então até o Terrário está começando a ser afetado. Pelo menos ainda deve ser um atalho útil.",
        "523382733075542016": "O ouro é um problema, né?",
        "523382733901819904": "Tem um atalho por aqui?",
        "523382734740680704": "Hora de seguir em frente.",
        "523382735625678848": "Qualquer lugar perto do Núcleo Prismático pode ser afetado pelas propriedades de alteração da realidade dele. Materiais mudando de um tipo pra outro, passando de sólido pra líquido ou gás, sumindo completamente...",
        "523382736426790912": "Fora do Labirinto, são mudanças aparentemente inofensivas, mas aqui, são perigosas. Imagina se a parte do chão onde você está simplesmente desaparece, ou se a única saída vira uma parede de pedra maciça...",
        "523382737257263104": "E o ouro... parece ser a transmutação mais potente, e provavelmente o destino desse mundo se ninguém fizer nada.",
        "523382738058375168": "Tudo isso me lembra o Rei Midas dos meus livros de histórias.",
        "523382738859487232": "Rei Midas?",
        "523382739689959424": "É um mito antigo sobre um rei chamado Midas que desejou que tudo o que ele tocasse virasse ouro. Ele ficou mais rico do que podia imaginar, mas logo descobriu que não podia mais comer nem beber, e acabou definhando.",
        "523382740512043008": "Quando descobri o Núcleo Prismático pela primeira vez, fiquei horrorizada ao ver todo o ecossistema virando ouro. Pedi ajuda, mas quem chegou só viu o valor daquele ouro.",
        "523382741329932288": "... Terminou em desastre quando tentaram usar todo o poder dele. Não vou deixar isso acontecer de novo. Não podemos deixar acontecer.",
        "523382742143627264": "Então é melhor eu correr e usar logo esse atalho?",
        "523382742982488064": "Certo, lembro que tinha um ali. Mas minha memória já não é mais tão confiável.",
        "523382743829737472": "Atalhos são coisas engraçadas. Espaço e tempo estão cheios deles, se você parar pra pensar... Digo, usei minhas memórias da área e tecnologia quântica pra montar esses projetores. Isso é um tipo de atalho temporal.",
        "523382744668598272": "Atalhos físicos são mais fáceis de reconhecer. Saber que existem caminhos rápidos de volta pra lugares onde você já esteve... pode mudar tudo, né? Pode mudar completamente o que você faria de outro jeito. Aconteceu comigo.",
        "523382745478098944": "Mas acho que, no fim das contas, a gente sempre acaba no mesmo lugar de alguma forma.",
        "523382746308571136": "Até breve, Beatrix.",
        "523383596829536256": "Beatrix, olha pela janela. Tem muito mais lá fora do que eu imaginava.",
        "523383597957804032": "Você já não esteve lá antes?",
        "523383598784081920": "Então por que colocou o projetor aqui?",
        "523383599606165504": "É incrível... mas é melhor eu seguir em frente.",
        "523383600424054784": "Eu não vi, não. Não me lembro de ter visto nada por aquelas janelas. Vi isso agora, pela primeira vez, quando você ativou o projetor.",
        "523383601229361152": "Sabe, naquela época, eu realmente achei que tinha explorado toda a instalação. Tinha certeza de que já tinha mapeado esse lugar inteiro.",
        "523383602017890304": "Mas em momentos como agora, eu vejo relances do que parece ser uma imensidão infinita lá fora, um labirinto até onde a vista alcança. Será que sempre esteve aqui e eu só… não percebi?",
        "523383602810613760": "Talvez não estivesse mesmo. Pode ter sido feito com arquitetura quântica. Isso significa que pode estar aqui num momento e desaparecer num piscar de olhos… ou até estar aqui e não estar ao mesmo tempo.",
        "523383603599142912": "Quer dizer, eu uso tecnologia quântica com bastante frequência. Seria tolice ignorar essa possibilidade.",
        "523383604450586624": "Como você tem usado tecnologia quântica?",
        "523383605264281600": "Sinto que devo continuar antes que esse lugar desapareça também.",
        "523383606057005056": "Ah, de algumas formas. Você está interagindo com uma agora.",
        "523383606879088640": "Os projetores em si não são quânticos, mas a forma como os posicionei foi. Você andou destrancando vários portões até chegar aqui, certo? Bom, não é como se eu tivesse passado por eles, colocado os projetores e depois trancado tudo de novo atrás de mim.",
        "523383607663423488": "Na época em que vim aqui pela primeira vez, tudo estava aberto e destrancado, então andei por todo canto. Usei tecnologia quântica pra posicionar os projetores nos lugares de que me lembrava de ter visto.",
        "523383608443564032": "Mas… minha memória não é mais tão confiável quanto era, então talvez alguns tenham se perdido no processo. Acho que vamos descobrir se e quando você ativá-los.",
        "523383609236287488": "E de qual lembrança você usou pra colocar esse aqui?",
        "523383610091925504": "Vou continuar procurando os outros, então.",
        "523383610918203392": "Bom, coloquei esse porque me lembrei dessa arvorezinha encantadora. É estranho, mas uma lembrança voltou pra mim de repente…",
        "523383611719315456": "Então, tinha um slime tigrado que sempre ficava rondando o rancho lá em casa. Era só um slime selvagem, mas ele aparecia o tempo todo, e à tarde sempre ia embora pulando.",
        "523383612520427520": "E um dia… decidi segui-lo.",
        "523383613338316800": "Ele me levou floresta adentro. Depois de um tempo, ele deu uma remexida em frente a uma árvore enorme e começou a escalá-la, pulando de galho em galho até o topo.",
        "523383614231703552": "Eu segui ele. No meio do caminho, perdi o slime de vista, mas continuei subindo. Logo, ultrapassei a copa das árvores e… Ah, Beatrix, eu não sei como descrever aquilo em palavras.",
        "523383615057981440": "Nunca tinha subido tão alto, e nunca tinha visto tanto do mundo vasto ao meu redor. Minha vida toda tinha sido só nos arredores do meu lar, e dali eu podia ver… tudo. Árvores cobrindo a Borda Muito Distante, pássaros voando…",
        "523383615863287808": "Foi de tirar o fôlego. Fiquei lá em cima por horas até minha mãe vir me procurar. Nossa, como ela brigou comigo.",
        "523383616693760000": "E não foi a última vez que eu desapareci pra ver mais do mundo…",
        "523383617561980928": "Vamos dar um jeito de você ver o mundo de novo.",
        "523383618426007552": "Melhor dar no pé, então. Até logo, Beatrix.",
        "523360220731830272": "Oi, Beatrix. \r",
        "523361207534120960": "Quero começar agradecendo de novo. Por sua causa, esse mundo tem um futuro. Todos nós temos.",
        "523368386513235968": "Sinto muito por ter deixado isso como uma gravação, mas eu precisava seguir em frente, e dizer que sou péssima em me despedir é pouco.",
        "527356088736706560": "Espera, como isso é possível?",
        "527357008383995904": "Infelizmente, ainda não posso te encontrar pessoalmente. Adoraria poder te agradecer de verdade. Mas me tranquei na instalação do outro lado dessa sala. Vou tentar te explicar tudo. Depois do que você passou pra chegar até aqui, é o mínimo que posso fazer.",
        "527357083470426112": "Então vamos começar de novo. Meu nome é…\r",
        "527357621113090048": "Gigi Twillgers-West.\r",
        "527357752021512192": "Sou neta de Hobson e Thora.\r",
        "527359885328412672": "Talvez você não acredite, mas… a resposta curta é que eu vim do futuro. No meu tempo, eu descobri a Ilha Arco-Íris e o Núcleo Prismático, e… as coisas deram muito errado. Ele estava se desestabilizando rapidamente, e quando tentei consertar, só piorei tudo. Chamei as pessoas erradas pra ajudar, e elas tentaram explorar o poder antinatural dele. ",
        "527360055189336064": "Tudo desmoronou depois disso. Houve uma explosão. Luz prismática se espalhou pela Ilha Arco-Íris e subiu até a atmosfera da Borda Muito Distante. Eu me protegi da explosão, mas meu braço… Algo aconteceu.",
        "527360305023053824": "A energia do Núcleo Prismático se imprimiu em mim. Consigo senti-la fluindo no meu braço, apesar dos meus esforços pra conter. É por isso que me isolei e precisei da sua ajuda: quando chego perto do Núcleo Prismático, a desestabilização acelera, como se ele reagisse à própria assinatura energética.",
        "527360902036090880": "Mas se você está aqui, e… E quanto à sua casa?",
        "527360988719771648": "Mas onde você está, Gigi?",
        "527361539041816576": "Meu mundo, a Borda Muito Distante do meu tempo… está à beira do desastre. A energia do Núcleo Prismático cobriu a atmosfera e começou a distorcer o ambiente, como está fazendo aqui: transformando árvores em metal, água em vidro, e até fazendo o mundo natural desaparecer da realidade.",
        "527361573745487872": "Com o tempo, não vai restar nada pra sustentar o ecossistema. Diante disso… sabendo que tive parte na causa… eu precisava fazer alguma coisa. ",
        "527363917346402304": "Então como você… viajou até aqui?\r",
        "527364226567270400": "Na sua aventura anterior pelo Deserto de Vidro, você se lembra quando meu avô te levou pra um \"portal além do espaço e do tempo\"? Quando você chegou lá, parecia estar em ruínas.",
        "527364268539670528": "Bom, é porque eu já tinha usado ele. Consegui direcionar o da minha época pra esse ponto na nossa linha do tempo. Só teve um problema…",
        "527364314953838592": "… Ele desmoronou com o choque de ser ativado quando cheguei. Eu não percebi que seria uma viagem só de ida.\r",
        "527365295787634688": "Então você está presa aqui?",
        "527365580824145920": "Sim. Talvez exista uma forma de consertar o portal, mas como tantas outras coisas aqui, está além do meu entendimento. Então preciso aceitar que nunca vou voltar pra casa… Nunca vou ver minha família de novo.",
        "527365598020792320": "Mas vai valer a pena se conseguirmos estabilizar o Núcleo Prismático. Se fizermos isso, não só salvamos tudo aqui e agora, mas também corrigimos meus erros no futuro. Preciso acreditar nisso.",
        "527366192357863424": "Como a gente estabiliza o Núcleo Prismático?\n",
        "527366405030047744": "Nas minhas pesquisas aqui, descobri que quem construiu o Labirinto Cinzento criou dispositivos chamados harmonizadores, projetados pra estabilizar o Núcleo Prismático… mas eles não funcionaram. Há indícios de que tentaram várias vezes, e cada uma delas só piorou a situação.",
        "527366769041108992": "Mas se não funcionaram antes, por que funcionariam agora?",
        "527367021353660416": "Vou ter que explicar isso depois. Mas acho que tenho algo que talvez eles não tinham… Algo que pode fazer funcionar dessa vez.",
        "527367034532163584": "Só tem um problema: os harmonizadores estão perdidos. Não há registro de onde estão. Na verdade, não há nem registro de como eles são. Estou completamente perdida e não sei o que fazer.",
        "527649944011173888": "Graças a você, eu posso sonhar de novo, sonhar com uma vida que eu possa chamar de minha. Graças a você, eu finalmente posso viver como quem eu sempre deveria ter sido. ",
        "527650043873357824": "Mas ainda há mais que eu preciso fazer. Preciso estudar o ecossistema e garantir que ele também possa seguir em frente, apesar dos danos que sofreu. Mas também preciso andar descalça na grama. Sentir o cheiro das flores no vento. ",
        "527650273687662592": "Preciso ficar quieta e observar as nuvens rastejando devagar pelo céu. E preciso visitar uma amiga e jogar Go até tarde da noite. ",
        "527650329715175424": "Preciso simplesmente viver, Beatrix.\r",
        "527650471629451264": "O Solário agora é seu. Eu sei que está em boas mãos. Pelo jeito como você cuidou dele, das criaturinhas bobas desse mundo, e pela forma como me ajudou tão generosamente aqui…",
        "527650601434771456": "Você tem um coração muito bom, Beatrix LeBeau. E eu estou muito feliz por ter te conhecido.",
        "527651735931088896": "Encerrar gravação.",
        "528371201086222336": "Funciona assim: o Núcleo Prismático está constantemente emitindo uma variedade caótica de ondas de energia que aparentemente tomam a forma de cores no nosso mundo. Mas ele está completamente fora de sintonia com o nosso mundo, de um jeito profundo, como se fosse algo elemental. É assim que ele distorce a realidade ao redor.",
        "528371269646315520": "Mas é aí que você entra. Os harmonizadores que você ativou emitem um pulso especial de energia que reverbera por todo o Labirinto. Juntos, eles formam um tipo de onda de energia harmoniosa e, quando direcionados ao Núcleo Prismático, tentam transformá-lo, torná-lo harmonioso também.",
        "528372202270781440": "Mas você disse que já tentaram isso antes e nunca funcionou.",
        "528372807345270784": "Sim, é verdade. Mas eu acho que tenho algo que os arquitetos desse sistema não tinham: meu braço. \r",
        "528372915524759552": "Eu consigo sentir as ondas de energia do Núcleo Prismático no meu braço. Eu consigo sentir o caos dele… e por isso acho que vou conseguir mudar sua frequência e criar essa harmonia. Porque eu vou poder senti-la diretamente.",
        "528373981557452800": "Ok, o que você precisa que eu faça?",
        "528374290384056320": "Assim que você estiver pronta, vou começar a sobrepor as frequências dos harmonizadores ao Núcleo Prismático. Isso vai causar perturbações incríveis e deixar o Núcleo Prismático em estado de caos até que a gente consiga estabilizá-lo de verdade.\r\n",
        "528374334084509696": "Esse caos vai ter um efeito volátil no mundo ao nosso redor, transmutando até os slimes em massas de horríveis brreus que vão encher essa sala e acabar destruindo tudo, a menos que façamos algo a respeito.",
        "528374369555738624": "Eu vou precisar que você lute e destrua todos os brreus antes que eles desestabilizem o Núcleo Prismático e nos levem junto. Normalmente, a água não pode existir aqui por muito tempo. Ela vira vidro perto do Núcleo Prismático.",
        "528374611244118016": "Mas os harmonizadores estão ressoando através da água que flui aqui agora. Então pegue quando puder e acabe com esses brreus!",
        "528375375807016960": "E se as coisas saírem do controle?",
        "528377335033524224": "Pode deixar comigo! Eu instalei uma ducha hídrica acima do Núcleo Prismático. Ela só precisa acumular pressão suficiente pra ser usada. Pra isso, encha ela de slimes! Além de talvez salvar o dia, você vai salvar alguns slimes também.\r\n",
        "528378858748669952": "Ah, e eu vou armazenar o conteúdo do seu tanque vac durante o processo, assim você vai ter bastante espaço pros slimes.\r",

        "528378958938009600": "Então, está pronta?\r",
        "528382405372440576": "Você pode me explicar como tudo isso vai funcionar de novo?",
        "528383473615532032": "Quando estiver pronta, podemos tentar de novo. Eu acredito em você.\r",
        "528405914672852992": "Estou pronta pra tentar mais uma vez.",
        "528406570288705536": "É isso, Beatrix. Com os harmonizadores ativados, e com a sua ajuda, posso tentar estabilizar o Núcleo Prismático. Você está pronta?",
        "528419886759309312": "Ah, é? O que ele disse? Nunca desistir? Continuar insistindo mesmo quando tudo está contra você? Minha mãe sempre dizia que o vovô tinha jeito com as palavras.",
        "528420089105117184": "Sabe, seu avô uma vez me deu um ótimo conselho.",
        "528420424708157440": "Ele disse: “Fique de olhos bem abertos.”",
        "528420990658179072": "Hã? Como assim?",
        "528421599239106560": "A única forma de encontrar algo escondido é procurando por ele.",
        "528422067466039296": "Mas por onde a gente começa?\r",
        "528422403345903616": "Eu vi umas paredes estranhas por aqui. Parece um bom ponto de partida.",
        "528422630249361408": "Beatrix, é isso! Eu ficava achando que encontraria uma porta ou algo assim que eu não pudesse entrar. Mas e se elas estiverem escondidas à vista? Eu… acho que posso criar uma nova tecnologia que você pode usar pra testar essa teoria.",
        "528422765066874880": "Vai até a Estação de Troca na varanda de cima e eu vou te preparar!\r",
        "528422907241197568": "Indo agora!",
        "528428037764182016": "O que acontece com o Núcleo Prismático agora?",
        "528428360129998848": "O tempo dirá, mas acho que ele pode continuar aqui como mais uma parte desse mundo que todos nós chamamos de lar. Os humanos nunca fizeram parte desse mundo até pousarmos aqui, e olha só pra nós agora! Conseguimos fazer parte disso sem destruir tudo no processo. É assim que deve ser.",
        "528428517668057088": "Até o Núcleo Prismático esteve perdido no vazio do espaço antes de cair aqui, e agora ele também faz parte desse mundo. Ele precisa encontrar seu verdadeiro lugar nisso tudo… assim como eu.",
        "528428667819945984": "Então agora você está livre?",
        "528428859898097664": "Eu consigo sentir uma mudança no meu braço. Ainda está conectado de algum jeito ao Núcleo Prismático, mas não é como antes. Agora tem um silêncio, só um leve zumbido de energia. É… pacífico.",
        "528428932321144832": "Vou precisar fazer mais testes pra ter certeza, mas acho que finalmente posso deixar essa câmara. \r",
        "528429148046782464": "Pra onde você vai?\r",
        "528429332436774912": "Tem algo que eu preciso fazer lá fora. Eu preciso finalmente conversar com alguém e contar que minha mãe tentou... que eu tentei... e que eu simplesmente não consegui ser a pessoa necessária. E que todo dia minha mãe sentia culpa por também não ser essa pessoa…",
        "528429399419809792": "Talvez eu não te veja por um tempo. Me desculpa.\r",
        "528429609311170560": "Às vezes nossas jornadas nos afastam dos amigos e de quem a gente ama.\r",
        "528431227981164544": "Como você lida com isso? ",
        "528432241819938816": "Uma vez me disseram que basta olhar pras estrelas.",
        "528432395541180416": "As estrelas?",

        "528433367000707072": "A luz delas estava aqui antes da gente, e vai continuar aqui depois.",
        "528433499536519168": "Espero que ela veja. Espero que ela saiba que estou segura agora.",
        "528433577198252032": "...",
        "528433676435484672": "Obrigada, Beatrix. Por tudo o que você fez aqui, por mim, e por tudo que ainda vai fazer. A Borda Muito Distante é um lugar melhor com você fazendo parte dela.",
        "528434010344026112": "Viaje com segurança, Gigi.",
        "528438915377033216": "Mas deixa isso pra lá. O mais importante agora é trabalhar naquele dispositivo de anulação. Então vai lá pegar esses plorts!",
        "528451741088903168": "Ah, e aliás, eu também posso trocar plorts prismáticos por moedas que você pode gastar em um tipo de mercado subterrâneo... Algo que descobri enquanto procurava por uma das tecnologias especiais que precisei pra construir minha instalação.\n",

        "108799766549622784": "Vaya, no, ¡solo olvidé encender la pantalla!",
        "108799766549622785": "¡Encantado de ver tu cara de nuevo, Beatrix! Te he extrañado mucho, mi querida amiga.",
        "108799766553817088": "Y aunque estoy bastante emocionado de que participes en una nueva aventura, ya tengo datos que podrían complicar las cosas...",
        "108799766553817089": "Anoche recibí un mensaje de algún tipo de programa de Inteligencia Artificial. Está escrito en código, pero no uno que reconozca. Estoy en proceso de analizarlo.",
        "108799766553817090": "Pero estoy seguro de que este mensaje fue enviado desde donde estás ahora, la misteriosa Isla Arcoíris.",
        "108799766553817091": "En resumen: un barco misterioso te lleva a una isla misteriosa y recibo un código misterioso de dicha isla misteriosa: todo parece bastante...",
        "108799766553817092": "...curioso. Bueno, tengo trabajo que hacer y será mejor que te pongas a explorar.",
        "108799766553817093": "¡Vaya! Casi lo olvido: toma este Portal Base. Debería facilitar las primeras etapas de su viaje.",
        "108799766553817094": "Cuídate, Beatrix. ¡Estaremos en contacto!",
        "108799766553817095": "¡Beatrix, lo he hecho! Creo que he descifrado el código súper misterioso que me enviaron.",
        "108799766553817096": "Fue asombrosamente complejo. Creo que la IA que creó este código muestra un intelecto comparable al mío. Tan avanzado... ¿casi alienígena?",
        "108799766553817097": "Oh, probablemente te estés preguntando qué dijo. Bueno, determiné que esta IA misteriosa, tal vez incluso alienígena, envió un mensaje que dice...",
        "108799766553817098": "...\"Hola\".",
        "108799766553817099": "¡No mucho, pero las cortesías cuentan para algo! Sin embargo, lo que es más importante, en el momento en que lo descifré, recibí otro mensaje.",
        "108799766553817100": "Es casi como si... ¿esta misteriosa IA me estuviera monitoreando? ¡Que emocionante!",
        "108799766553817101": "Todavía no lo he descifrado, pero el código es considerablemente más complejo. ¡Esto debería ser divertido! Bueno, de vuelta al trabajo como siempre.",
        "108799766553817102": "Hola Beatrix. Quería decirte que he descifrado otro de los cifrados de la IA. Se había adaptado claramente a mi solución anterior y creó algo aún más complejo. Inteligente.",
        "108799766553817103": "Esta vez, el código reveló un conjunto de instrucciones para la comunicación de ida y vuelta. Así que he estado pasando mi tiempo hablando con él.",
        "108799766553817104": "Hace muchas preguntas. Después de conocerme me ha estado preguntando mucho sobre mi trabajo. Casi como si sintiera las áreas de mi experiencia.",
        "108799766553817105": "Debo admitir que todo ha sido bastante halagador. Estoy acostumbrado a ser el que hace las preguntas. Durante un tiempo toda mi vida fueron preguntas y la investigación que siguió...",
        "108799766553817106": "Después de haber experimentado eso durante tanto tiempo, creo que puedo sentir lo mismo en los demás. Y aunque esto puede parecer extraño, lo siento en la IA.",
        "108799766553817107": "Verás, cuando comencé a hacer mis propias preguntas, la forma en que me respondió, sentí que estaba tratando de protegerse...",
        "108799766553817108": "...para esconder una profunda soledad que tiene dentro de su corazón.",
        "108799766553817109": "Extraño, lo sé. Después de todo, es una IA, pero ¿quién puede decir que cualquier forma de inteligencia no desearía una conexión con otra?",
        "108799766553817110": "Siento que hay más en esta historia. Y si no, estoy feliz de simplemente haber estado allí para mi nuevo amigo. Seguir haciendo preguntas para que tengan razones para encontrar respuestas.",
        "108799766553817111": "Te informaré más tarde.",
        "108799766553817112": "¡Beatrix! Tengo algo que debo compartir contigo sobre la IA.",
        "108799766553817113": "Como sabes, hemos estado intercambiando preguntas entre nosotros. Bueno, este ir y venir se volvió más rápido y casual con el tiempo, casi como una conversación natural.",
        "108799766553817114": "Supuse que simplemente estaba evolucionando y adaptándose al estilo de hablar que observaba en mí, pero luego algo sucedió...",
        "108799766553817115": "Bueno, habíamos comenzado a jugar Go mientras hablábamos. Una forma en que podría probar aún más su intelecto y sin duda cómo podría probar el mío.",
        "108799766553817116": "Estos juegos duraban hasta bien entrada la noche. Y también nuestras conversaciones, sintiéndose cada vez más naturales a pesar de que sabía que la entidad con la que estaba hablando era solo una colección compleja de código.",
        "108799766553817117": "Y luego, un día, cuando el sol estaba saliendo, sugirió solo un juego más. Dije ciertamente, pero necesitaba prepararme una taza de café si quería permanecer despierto para ello...",
        "108799766553817118": "...y respondió, \"yo también\".",
        "108799766553817119": "Me quedé mirando la pantalla, sin saber qué decir. Pero de repente, como si supiera lo que acababa de hacer, se desconectó.",
        "108799766553817120": "No he sabido nada de... ellos desde entonces. Pero espero hacerlo.",
        "108799766553817121": "Hasta entonces esperaré, manteniéndome ocupado con mi trabajo como siempre, haciendo esas preguntas que necesitan respuestas. Pero lo haré con el tablero Go listo para otro juego... algún día de todos modos.",
        "108799766553817122": "Adiós, Beatrix. Espero volver a hablar pronto.",
        "108799766553817123": "Hola Beatrix. Espero que no sea demasiado presuntuoso, pero te traigo esto. Yo, um, espero que te guste.",
        "108799766553817124": "Por lo general, uso un algoritmo para identificar los obsequios apropiados, pero en este caso simplemente... se me ocurrió.",
        "108799766553817125": "Estoy de acuerdo, la espontaneidad también me asusta.",
        "108799766553817126": "Beatrix! Necesito un punto de datos tuyos. Estoy realizando un experimento sobre el impacto psicológico de la recepción de regalos.",
        "108799766553817127": "Por favor, dime cuál de los siguientes sentimientos experimentas: gratitud, alegría o tal vez... ¿hambre?",
        "108799766553817128": "Por favor, no consumas este regalo.",
        "108799766553817129": "Oh, Beatrix, pase toda la noche sintetizando el regalo perfecto para ti. Formulé hipótesis, hice pruebas, deseché los resultados, empecé de nuevo…",
        "108799766553817130": "Finalmente descubrí un método alternativo: comprar algo en línea.",
        "108799766553817131": "El proceso fue sorprendentemente sencillo.",
        "108799766553817132": "Hola Beatrix. Quería expresar mi gratitud por la ayuda que me has brindado desde que te conocí. Con tu apoyo, creo que he mejorado como persona.",
        "108799766553817133": "Según mi investigación, un regalo de una pequeña chuchería sería apropiado. Así que por favor, toma esto.",
        "108799766553817134": "Ah, Beatrix. Estaba limpiando el laboratorio y encontré esto. ¿Quizás tienes algún uso para ello? Creo que todavía está en funcionamiento.",
        "108799766553817135": "Ya sabes lo que dicen, la basura de una persona es el regalo apresurado de otra persona. ¡Disfrútalo!",
        "108799766553817136": "Oh hola. Debo decirte que vi este artículo y solo gritaba \"¡Beatrix!\"",
        "108799766553817137": "... y así fue como me di cuenta de que accidentalmente lo había golpeado con el Rayo de Sentiencia. Pero no te preocupes, todo está bien y muy normal ahora.",
        "108799766553817138": "De todos modos, pensé que deberías tenerlo. ¡Disfrútalo!",
        "108799766553817139": "Lo siento, Beatrix. En este momento no tengo tiempo. Estoy en medio de una discusión entre una tostadora y mi lavadora.",
        "108799766553817140": "Estoy realizando experimentos de robótica de nuevo. ¡Van bastante bien!",
        "108799766553817141": "Disculpa Beatrix, pero en este momento no estoy disponible para entablar una conversación, charla, discurso o incluso bromas ociosas.",
        "108799766553817142": "¿Tal vez en otro momento?",
        "108799766553817143": "¡Hola Beatrix! A pesar de las apariencias, este no es Viktor, sino un holograma de Viktor que Viktor ha desarrollado para recibir mensajes para Viktor, que no soy yo.",
        "108799766553817144": "Deja tu mensaje y me aseguraré de que el mensaje no me sea dado a mí, sino a Viktor.",
        "108799766553817145": "¿Bueno, qué sabes? ¿Beatrix LeBeau se fue a otra aventura y no pensó en llevar a su buena amiga, a veces rival y mentora para siempre, Mochi Miles?",
        "108799766553817146": "En serio, Bea, la próxima vez que vayas corriendo a un territorio peligroso e inexplorado, ¿podrías al menos avisarme?",
        "108799766553817147": "Me gustaría estar ahí para ti en caso de que me necesites…",
        "108799766553817148": "…para ayudar a recolectar todos esos valiosos recursos que parecen estar dispersos por toda la isla.",
        "108799766553817149": "¿Qué? ¿Crees que no iba a hacer un pequeño reconocimiento por mi cuenta? ¿De qué sirven los satélites de vigilancia si no pueden espiar cosas?",
        "108799766553817150": "…",
        "108799766553817151": "De todos modos, ten cuidado ahí fuera. La isla me da una especie de ambiente extraño. Así que voy a seguir hurgando.",
        "108799766553817152": "Ah, y como sé que estás empezando desde cero, toma este enlace de refinería. Debería facilitarte las cosas. Lo pondré en tu cuenta. Nos vemos, cocodrilo.",
        "108799766553817153": "Oye, Bea, esos drones que has estado encontrando por toda la isla… tienen algo raro.",
        "108799766553817154": "¿Hmm?",
        "108799766553817155": "Oye, tengo ojos en el cielo y los voy a usar. También estoy preparando un equipo de drones para ir allí y revisar las cosas de una manera más práctica, pero estoy divagando…",
        "108799766553817156": "De todos modos, ese dron parece superavanzado, como casi alienígena. Así que pensé, está bien, hay algunos extraterrestres por ahí explorando la Isla Arcoíris, como tú. Pero no, no lo creo.",
        "108799766553817157": "Porque se parece mucho a los drones que usamos… pero es mucho más familiar para mí. Casi como si me estuviera dando un déjà vu. ¡Es un poco espeluznante!",
        "108799766553817158": "Oye, no tengas miedo. Probablemente sean solo extraterrestres. Extraterrestres gigantes de tres cabezas con enormes garras que buscan humanos para capturar, o comer, o AMBOS.",
        "108799766553817159": "¡Juar, juar, juar!",
        "108799766553817160": "Hasta luego, Bea.",
        "108799766553817161": "¡Bea! He estado tratando de localizarte. He analizado uno de los drones que has ido encontrando por toda esa isla y sé por qué me resulta tan familiar: es mío.",
        "108799766553817162": "O al menos, es uno que he visto antes… en mis sueños, de todos modos.",
        "108799766553817163": "Después de mirar los escaneos que tomé, supe que me resultaba familiar, así que comencé a buscar en algunos de mis viejos diarios de Ciencia Slime. Esos diarios tienen en su mayoría proyectos futuros, pero a veces se trata de tecnología especulativa.",
        "108799766553817164": "Ya me conoces, siempre estoy pensando seis pasos adelante para mantener a Mochi Tech en la cima de la industria. Bueno, a veces se me ocurre lo imposible, cosas que nunca podría diseñar en mi vida.",
        "108799766553817165": "Bueno, esos drones que estás encontrando son exactamente eso: imposibles con la tecnología actual y están tomados directamente de las páginas de mis diarios. ¡Son algo que vi en un sueño, Bea!",
        "108799766553817166": "Entonces, ¿cómo un montón de drones imposibles que diseñé en un sueño encontraron el camino desde las páginas de mis diarios hasta la Isla Arcoíris?",
        "108799766553817167": "…",
        "108799766553817168": "Tal vez… tal vez haya algún tipo de archivo en ellos que podamos desbloquear para obtener más información. Sé que contienen registros de datos, pero si fuera yo… bueno, siempre sé cómo encontrar una manera de retener lo que necesito…",
        "108799766553817169": "Muy bien, Bea, necesito algo de tiempo para pensar. Te avisaré si se me ocurre algo. Tal vez lo consulte con la almohada…",
        "108799766553817170": "Hola, Bea, tengo algo para que pruebes y, para ser honesta, si funciona, me asustaré mucho.",
        "108799766553817171": "Creé un plano de una clave: una clave de archivo especial para los drones que has estado encontrando. Si existe algún dato de archivo en ellos, esta debería ser la forma de acceder a él.",
        "108799766553817172": "Digo “debería” porque en realidad no tengo ni idea. Pero si esos drones son de las páginas de mis propios diarios, bueno, esta clave es cómo accedería a sus archivos, si alguna vez construyera algo como ellos.",
        "108799766553817173": "Sé que esto apenas tiene sentido, pero necesito que lo intentes. Si funciona y existe un archivo y de alguna manera te permite entender lo que está pasando en esa isla más de lo que lo haces ahora…",
        "108799766558011392": "…bueno, me alegro de haberte podido ayudar. Todavía te debo una, ¿verdad?",
        "108799766558011393": "Uf. ¡Yo no dije eso! Solo haz la tonta llave y no me digas todavía si funciona o no.",
        "108799766558011394": "Porque si lo hace, realmente no creo que esté lista para lidiar con eso.",
        "108799766558011395": "Ahí nos vemos, cocodrilo. Y buena suerte.",
        "108799766558011396": "Oye, Bea, encontré algo que iba a tirar, pero luego pensé que a Bea le gustan los trastos viejos que no necesito. Apuesto a que a ella le encantaría esto.",
        "108799766558011397": "Me lo puedes agradecer después.",
        "108799766558011398": "¡Hoooola, Beatrix! ¿Adivina quién es la persona más afortunada de la galaxia?",
        "108799766558011399": "¡ERES TÚ! ¡Porque tienes un regalo de la mismísima Mochi Miles!",
        "108799766558011400": "Dejaré que eso se asiente. Adelante, siéntate si lo necesitas.",
        "108799766558011401": "Oye, Bea, ¿no dijiste algo hace un tiempo sobre que querías más cosas?",
        "108799766558011402": "Hmmm… espera, creo que fui yo.",
        "108799766558011403": "Bueno, lo que sea, disfruta de más cosas.",
        "108799766558011404": "Oye, Bea, te tengo un regalo, porque, no sé. De todos modos, espero que te guste.",
        "108799766558011405": "O no… como sea.",
        "108799766558011406": "¡Ey, Bea! Te tengo algo pequeño, énfasis en pequeño.",
        "108799766558011407": "Porque me compré algo GRANDE para mí. Es mucho mejor.",
        "108799766558011408": "Lo siento, Bea, no puedo hablar, estoy superocupada con algunas cosas realmente importantes.",
        "108799766558011409": "Como si fuera mucho más importante que lo que quieres, lo siento. No tengo tiempo para escuchar cómo estás.",
        "108799766558011410": "Pero es bueno, ¿verdad?",
        "108799766558011411": "Lo siento, Bea, llegué tarde a una reunión y, por cierto, ¿cómo está mi cabello? Es broma, siempre es perfecto. Tengo que correr, así que ¡adióooooos!",
        "108799766558011412": "Te arrepentirás de haberte cruzado con Mochi Miles, solo espera y…",
        "108799766558011413": "¡Ay, Bea! Lo siento, pensé que esta era la otra línea. Solo estoy arreglando algunas cosas con uno de mis competidores. Solo una charla amistosa.",
        "108799766558011414": "¡Hola, Beatrix! ¿Estás ahí? ¡Soy yo, Ogden Ortiz!",
        "108799766558011415": "¿Escuché que estás en una gran y nueva aventura en una isla misteriosa llena de secretos y peligros y tal vez algunas frutas o verduras suculentas que el mundo nunca ha visto antes...?",
        "108799766558011416": "¡Sabes que tenía que preguntar! ¡Desde que me conseguiste un suministro constante de frutas kookadoba, he estado alcanzando alturas culinarias aún mayores dentro de la Lejana, Lejana Pradera!",
        "108799766558011417": "...además, me estoy cansando bastante de comer pastel de kookadoba, suflé de kookadoba, pudín de kookadoba, kookadoba con carne, kookadoba con... kookadoba.",
        "108799766558011418": "Me estoy quedando sin ideas... y fuerza de voluntad.",
        "108799766558011419": "Así que si ves algo nuevo, cuéntamelo todo. Dejando a un lado las delicias, quiero saber todo sobre la nueva flora y fauna que descubras.",
        "108799766558011420": "Nunca lo olvides: cada pedacito de este mundo salvaje es precioso y merece nuestro cuidado y respeto.",
        "108799766558011421": "¡Y mantente hidratada ahí fuera! Todas esas aventuras te harán sudar, así que toma este grifo de agua.",
        "108799766558011422": "Buena suerte, Beatrix. Mantenme informado. ¡Te estoy apoyando!",
        "108799766558011423": "¡Beatrix! Me alegro que hayas llamado.",
        "108799766558011424": "Revisé las fotos que me enviaste de la Isla Arcoíris. ¡Sin duda son un espectáculo para la vista! Hermosa, con colores que solo se vuelven más ricos cuanto más miras...",
        "108799766558011425": "...pero antinatural también. Lo siento, pero algo en ese lugar no está bien.",
        "108799766558011426": "Como recordarás, una vez fui el jefe de una corporación de comida instantánea muy exitosa. La alteración genética de los alimentos era nuestra especialidad.",
        "108799766558011427": "No estoy orgulloso de todo lo que hicimos para alterar los alimentos naturales para que crecieran más grandes, más rápidos y más baratos: para despojarlos de las cosas buenas en favor de las ganancias.",
        "108799766558011428": "Digo esto Beatrix, porque todavía puedo detectar una planta que ha sido alterada de forma no natural cuando la veo. Y los hermosos arcoíris que ves ante ti en esa isla no llegaron allí de forma natural.",
        "108799766558011429": "No me queda claro si esto significa algún tipo de peligro para ti, pero me da una sensación de malestar en el estómago. Necesito hacer más investigación y te diré después.",
        "108799766558011430": "Mantente a salvo, amiga.",
        "108799766558011431": "BOOOOSTEEEZOOO",
        "108799766558011432": "¡Oh, lo siento, Beatrix! He estado dedicando algunas largas noches a leer últimamente.",
        "108799766558011433": "Específicamente, he estado revisando cada guía de campo y trabajo de investigación botánica que pude desenterrar de la Lejana, Lejana Pradera.",
        "108799766558011434": "Pensé que incluso si la flora en Isla Arcoíris no es natural, tal vez se habría registrado en algún lugar con alguna información que podríamos usar.",
        "108799766558011435": "Y resulta que no hay nada. No puedo encontrar una sola mención de la flora de colores del arcoíris en ninguna parte. Eso significa que lo que sea que sucedió en esa isla para que se vea de la manera en que lo hace, sucedió hace relativamente poco tiempo.",
        "108799766558011436": "Pero no creo que necesitaras que te dijera esto, porque creo que lo has visto tú. Las cosas que has descrito, ¿una parte entera de la isla dividida entre dos colores diferentes justo en el medio...?",
        "108799766558011437": "...eso me dice \"accidente\", Beatrix.",
        "108799766558011438": "Así que ándate con cuidado por ahí. La naturaleza puede ser algo peligrosa para nosotros, pero palidece en comparación con lo que podemos hacerle.",
        "108799766558011439": "Voy a seguir buscando en mi biblioteca cualquier otra cosa que pueda ayudarte. Y si me quedo corto, ¡quizás te hornee unos muffins!",
        "108799766558011440": "De cualquier manera, te tengo, Beatrix. ¡Adiós!",
        "108799766558011441": "¡Hola, Beatrix! Es bueno verte. Espero que te hayas estado cuidando por ahí, tomándote el tiempo para llenar tu barriga antes de cada nuevo descenso a lo desconocido.",
        "108799766558011442": "Además, entiendo que la trama se ha espesado como una buena salsa y te has encontrado con algún tipo de estructura monolítica en el otro extremo de la isla.",
        "108799766558011443": "¡Cosas de miedo! Pero tal vez mi corazonada sea correcta de que toda la extraña flora que hay no es natural...",
        "108799766558011444": "Algo simplemente no encaja aquí, Beatrix. Todas las ruinas que hemos descubierto en la Lejana, Lejana Pradera nunca han parecido haber dañado el medio ambiente de ninguna manera.",
        "108799766558011445": "Claro, no sabemos su propósito o quién los construyó, pero la sensación que siempre tuve fue que tenían respeto por este mundo.",
        "108799766558011446": "Pero tal vez sucedió de todos modos. A veces, cuando vas de excursión, pisas una flor para no aplastarla solo para pisar otra.",
        "108799766558011447": "A veces, la única manera de que esas flores sigan creciendo es que, en primer lugar, nunca hayas estado cerca de ellas.",
        "108799766558011448": "Pero no todo es pesimismo: la Isla Arcoíris todavía parece estar prosperando, por ahora. La naturaleza puede encontrar un equilibrio, pero no es una garantía.",
        "108799766558011449": "¡Ay! Mírame, siendo sermoneador contigo. Lo siento, Beatrix. no te entretendré",
        "108799766558011450": "No sé qué encontrarás más allá de esos muros, pero confío en tus botas en cualquier jardín. Sé que harás lo correcto.",
        "108799766558011451": "Buena suerte, Beatrix.",
        "108799766558011452": "¡Hola amiga! Te traje un pequeño regalo. No es casero, y no es una tarta , y no es una tarta casera...",
        "108799766558011453": "...pero pensé que te gustaría de todos modos. Aunque lástima de la tarta...",
        "108799766558011454": "¡Hola, Bea! Te compré algo que podría ser bueno tener por ahí.",
        "108799766558011455": "Pero si ya tienes uno, no puedo devolverlo así que... cuantos más mejor, ¿no?",
        "108799766558011456": "¡Hola Bea, tengo algo especial para ti! Parecía lo correcto en ese momento...",
        "108799766558011457": "Oh, pero ahora no estoy tan seguro. Um, si no es así, por favor no me lo digas. ¡No puedo soportar escucharlo!",
        "108799766558011458": "Bea, si hay algo que sé sobre el tipo de vida de exploradora solitaria que llevas, es que no puedes tener suficientes recordatorios de que tus amigos están pensando en ti.",
        "108799766558011459": "¡Así que aquí hay un recordatorio! ...en forma de regalo. Deja que te recuerde a mí y a todos nuestros buenos momentos juntos. ¡Hasta luego, Bea!",
        "108799766558011460": "Hola amiga, ¿cómo te sientes por ahí? Cuando me siento solo, salgo y hago algo bueno por un amigo. ¡Me hace sentir bien como la lluvia cada vez!",
        "108799766558011461": "Esta es solo mi pequeña manera de decir que estoy pensando en ti.",
        "108799766558011462": "Lo siento Bea, ¡no puedo conversar! ¡Todas mis gallinallinas han volado del gallinero! ¡Es un tumulto arrojando plumas por aquí! Si no respondo mañana, es porque me han derrocado.",
        "108799766558011463": "Lo siento, Bea, pero estoy a punto de sacar un suflé muy grande del horno y eso requiere mi máxima concentración.",
        "108799766558011464": "Después de eso, comeré un suflé muy grande y eso requerirá mi máxima concentración.",
        "108799766558011465": "Hola amiga, no puedo hablar, tengo mucho en mi plato en este momento. Concretamente una curiosa ensalada de cebolla que está en su punto máximo de madurez.",
        "108799766558011466": "Tuve que comer tantas zanahorias para esto, ¡no me lo pierdo!",
        "108799766558011467": "Bueno, ahora, ¡si no es Beatrix LeBeau! El viejo Hobby y yo estábamos hablando de ti. ¿Se dice que te fuiste a partes desconocidas de esta roca con sed de nuevas aventuras?",
        "108799766558011468": "¡Ay chica! Sigues caminando para ver qué nuevas maravillas hay a la vuelta de la siguiente esquina hasta que tus botas tienen agujeros. ¡Y luego consíguete unas botas nuevas y hazlo un poco más!",
        "108799766558011469": "Yo, bueno, mis botas han visto días mejores, pero sé que todavía les quedan una aventura o dos. Supongo que solo necesito averiguar qué...",
        "108799766558011470": "Diablos, estoy divagando como lo hace Hobson después de hablar sobre la exploración, el cosmos, la cocina o casi cualquier otro tema.",
        "108799766558011471": "Muy bien, Bea, aguanta. Te llamaré para ver cómo estás. No importa quién seas, todos empezamos a sentirlo cuando el hogar está más allá del horizonte.",
        "108799766558011472": "Ah, y antes de que se me olvide, aquí hay algo para que arregles tu nuevo lugar. No es mucho, pero debes hacer lo que puedas para que ese lugar se sienta acogedor.",
        "108799766558011473": "¡Hola, Bea! ¿Cómo es la vida en Isla Arcoíris? Dios, incluso es divertido decirlo. ¡Debe ser muy divertido!",
        "108799766558011474": "Sabes, desde que escuché que estabas haciendo algo nuevo, me puse a pensar en mi propia vida y cuál es la próxima 'nueva' para mí.",
        "108799766558011475": "Hobson y yo hemos visto y hecho mucho en nuestras vidas, hemos tenido una aventura tras otra a través de esta roca polvorienta. Y desde que nos conocimos no hemos disminuido ni un poco.",
        "108799766558011476": "Así que estamos buscando emprender una nueva aventura, juntos. Pero simplemente no hemos descubierto qué o dónde.",
        "108799766558011477": "Tal vez vayamos a explorar algún rincón escondido de la Lejana, Lejana Pradera como tú, o incluso fijemos nuestra vista en las estrellas como lo había hecho Hobson antes.",
        "108799766558011478": "Lo que sea que decidamos hacer, será aún más especial porque esta vez lo compartiremos entre nosotros. ¡Es esa parte la que lo hace aún más emocionante!",
        "108799766558011479": "Es tan difícil encontrar a alguien en este mundo que te encaje completamente, algo tan raro. Como encontrar dos copos de nieve idénticos en el desierto.",
        "108799766558011480": "...Sé que sientes eso más de lo que puedo decir.",
        "108799766558011481": "Nunca perderé de vista lo afortunados que somos, Bea. Quiero usar los dones que el universo ha creído conveniente darme.",
        "108799766558011482": "...",
        "108799766558011483": "Mantén la cabeza en alto, niña. Charlaremos de nuevo pronto.",
        "108799766558011484": "Oh, Bea, me alegro de haber podido atraparte. Tengo grandes noticias para compartir y esta roca no está repleta de gente cuyos oídos pueda doblar.",
        "108799766558011485": "Hobson y yo hemos estado pensando mucho en qué nueva aventura nos espera. Hemos estado leyendo los diarios de viaje del otro tratando de encontrar lugares en los que ninguno de nosotros haya estado.",
        "108799766558011486": "Pero a pesar de que encontramos algunos, ninguno de ellos realmente nos llamaba. ¿Quizás las cosas finalmente se estaban calmando?",
        "108799766558011487": "Luego nos pusimos a hablar y nos dimos cuenta de que lo que más amamos es simplemente estar aquí juntos en mi rancho.",
        "108799766558011488": "Este rancho fue uno de los primeros en la Lejana, Lejana Pradera, y ambos aprendimos mucho... así que empezamos a hablar sobre tal vez pasarle todo eso a alguien...",
        "108799766558011489": "... así que Hobson y yo hemos decidido formar una familia, Bea. Y por primera vez desde que tengo memoria, ¡tengo miedo!",
        "108799766558011490": "Hobson y yo somos tan independientes que no sabemos nada sobre ser padres, y mucho menos criar a un niño en la Lejana, Lejana Pradera.",
        "108799766558011491": "Pero amo a ese viejo idiota y la idea de ver a un pequeño mirándome con sus ojos me hace sonreír...",
        "108799766558011492": "Creo que solo eso me hace sentir que movería una montaña para que esto sucediera.",
        "108799766558011493": "Así que tengo algo de trabajo que hacer aquí. ¡Tanto que poner en orden!",
        "108799766558011494": "Gracias por escucharme, Bea. A veces, simplemente compartir tus miedos con alguien te hace sentir que ya no estás solo con esos miedos.",
        "108799766558011495": "Cuídate, Bea.",
        "108799766558011496": "Hola Bea, ¿cómo va la exploración? Se dice que estás hasta el cuello de misterios allí. ¡Claro que suena emocionante!",
        "108799766558011497": "¡Yo me pregunto por qué las cosas de bebés son tan innecesariamente difíciles! He escalado montañas que fueron más fáciles que armar una cuna con esta llave allen diminuta que te dan...",
        "108799766558011498": "De todos modos, Hobson y yo solo queríamos darte las gracias. No creo que nos hubiéramos dado cuenta de que queríamos un niño sin ti en nuestras vidas.",
        "108799766558011499": "Siempre vi un poco de mí en ti, y después de que restauraste el viejo y polvoriento rancho de Hobson, nos dimos cuenta de que no solo importan las marcas que hemos dejado en este mundo, sino que es genial ver a un grupo más joven hacer algo nuevo. con todo",
        "108799766558011500": "Así que será un verdadero placer ver lo que nuestro pequeño termina haciendo con este rancho, o donde sea que lo lleve su corazón.",
        "108799766558011501": "Así que gracias, Bea. Hobson y yo estamos mejor si tú fueras una pequeña parte de nuestras vidas. Y te deseo lo mejor, siempre.",
        "108799766558011502": "Ah, pero una cosa más...",
        "108799766558011503": "Hobson quería saber por qué decidiste no usar ese gran dispositivo antiguo en las ruinas del Desierto de Cristal para emprender una gran aventura a través del cosmos.",
        "108799766558011504": "Le dije: “Hobson Twillgers, la decisión de una mujer de viajar a través del espacio y el tiempo es suya y solo suya”. Pero él es terco y curioso al mismo tiempo.",
        "108799766558011505": "... ¿eh?",
        "108799766558011506": "¿Estaba descompuesto? Bueno, eso no suena bien... Hobson dijo que dejó esa cosa cebada y lista para funcionar antes de irse y marcharse. Dijo que estaba dejando la puerta abierta para la próxima alma aventurera.",
        "108799766558011507": "Bueno, bueno, Beatrix LeBeau... parece que te acabas de encontrar otro misterio.",
        "108799766558011508": "¡Buena suerte con eso, Bea! Tal vez cuando todo esto esté hecho deberías escribir un libro sobre ello. ¡Sería una gran historia de aventuras!",
        "108799766562205696": "Hola, Bea. Quería darte algo bueno, así que intenté hacerte galletas pero, eh, hornear no es exactamente mi área de especialización...",
        "108799766562205697": "Hobson dijo que eran tan, tan, taaaan... comestibles.",
        "108799766562205698": "...de todos modos, te compré algo en su lugar. ¡Espero que te guste!",
        "108799766562205699": "Ya sabes, Bea, dicen que los mejores regalos vienen del corazón.",
        "108799766562205700": "Este vino de una tienda... pero lo suficientemente cerca, ¿verdad?",
        "108799766562205701": "Hola, Bea, sé que es una tontería, pero me preocupa el trabajo duro que haces por tu cuenta...",
        "108799766562205702": "Así que te envié un pequeño paquete de ayuda. ¡Espero que te dé un poco más de energía!",
        "108799766562205703": "¡Jajaja, no te preocupes, se lo diré! ¡Cállate ahora, estoy hablando con ella!",
        "108799766562205704": "Hola, Bea, Hobson quería que tuvieras esto... dice que si no lo quieres, ¡será una buena leña!",
        "108799766562205705": "Siempre me alegra saber de ti, cariño, pero tengo que ir a buscar a Hobson: el tractor se estropeó de nuevo en el campo. ¡Le diré que saludaste!",
        "108799766562205706": "Bea, me temo que no puedo charlar ahora. La tormenta se está gestando en mi parte del bosque y también lo está esta taza de café que estoy preparando. Ambos exigen mi atención. ¡Tengo que irme!",
        "108799766562205707": "Lo siento Bea, necesito esta línea abierta para Hobson. Tiene un amigo con el que le gusta charlar todo el día sobre quién sabe qué. Un tipo extraño con una gabardina. No puedo dar ni pies ni cabeza.",

        "418299640694861835": "Aquello, que yo llamo Nucleoprisma, cambia las propiedades de todo a su alrededor. Primero empieza por los colores, pero luego se producen cambios materiales y elementales…",
        "418299640694861836": "Atraviesa el Laberinto Gris y búscame. No puedo abandonar mi puesto, pero puedo comunicarme contigo con estos dispositivos a medida que te topes con ellos.",
        "418299640694861837": "Una vez que me encuentres, intentaremos detener lo que ocurre aquí.",
        "418299640694861838": "Necesito que me ayudes a salvar la Isla Arcoíris… y puede que hasta toda la Lejana, Lejana Pradera.",
        "418299640694861839": "Verás, cuando llegué a la Isla Arcoíris, me deslumbró su belleza. No se parecía a ningún lugar que hubiera conocido antes. Pero, a la larga, descubrí que esta belleza tiene su precio.",
        "418299640694861840": "Hace mucho, algo del espacio exterior se estrelló contra lo que hoy es la Isla Arcoíris y, poco a poco, comenzó a cambiarlo todo.",
        "418299640694861841": "Las rocas y los acantilados resplandecieron de color y luego ondularon con vetas de los mismos tonos prismáticos que brotaban de la hierba y demás flora.",
        "418299640694861842": "Incluso en la atmósfera de aquí hay como un hipercolor. Está por todas partes. Todo se extiende desde aquello que vino del espacio.",
        "418299640694861843": "Aquello, que yo llamo Nucleoprisma, cambia las propiedades de todo a su alrededor. Primero empieza por los colores, pero luego se producen cambios materiales y elementales…",
        "418299640694861844": "Necesito que atravieses el Laberinto Gris y que me busques. No puedo abandonar mi puesto, pero puedo comunicarme contigo con estos dispositivos a medida que te topes con ellos.",
        "418299640694861845": "Haré lo posible por responder más preguntas cuando las vayas teniendo. Pero, demonios, se siente muy bien hablar con otro ser humano. Ha pasado tanto tiempo…",
        "418299640694861846": "Buena suerte, Beatrix. Y mantente alerta cuando los colores se intensifiquen. Será una locura.",
        "418299640694861847": "Parece que me conoces, pero yo no te conozco a ti…",
        "418299640694861848": "¿Así que tú fuiste quien me envió la carta y el barco que me trajeron hasta aquí?",
        "418299640694861849": "¿Ayudarte con qué?",
        "418299640694861850": "¿Cómo lo detenemos?",
        "418299640694861851": "Repíteme por qué necesitas mi ayuda.",
        "418299640694861852": "Bien, Gigi, te veré adentro.",
        "433459818587123712": "Mientras tanto, haré lo posible por responder más preguntas cuando las vayas teniendo. Pero, demonios, incluso si no se te ocurre ninguna, se sentirá muy bien hablar con otro ser humano. Ha pasado tanto tiempo…",
        "433468706430545920": "Hola de nuevo, Beatrix. ¿Necesitas algo?",
        "434144876759248896": "¿No es bonito? A pesar de todo, una parte de mí aún se alegra de volver a verlo…",
        "434144879288414208": "¿Aún estoy… dentro del Laberinto…?",
        "434144879774953472": "Estaba en una sala con luces extrañas y se desató la locura.",
        "434144880240521216": "Voy a volver a explorar.",
        "434144880701894656": "Sí, aunque parezca increíble, sigues dentro del Laberinto. Es una recreación completa de aspectos del entorno exterior, hasta la atmósfera.",
        "434144881163268096": "Pero lo más asombroso es su tamaño. Es incluso más grande en el interior que en el exterior. ¡Te vuela la cabeza!",
        "434144881654001664": "Al principio, no todo tendrá sentido aquí, y quizás nunca lo haga. Así que, haz lo tuyo: explora, recolecta y descubre la mejor manera de recorrer este lugar.",
        "434144882119569408": "Con el tiempo, resultará valioso saber cómo moverte y comprender cómo funciona todo aquí.",
        "434144882580942848": "Cuando algunas partes del Laberinto empiecen a brillar y una luz radiante lo invada todo, ten cuidado.",
        "434144883059093504": "A este fenómeno lo llamo “alteración prismática”. Son ráfagas inestables de energía que genera el Nucleoprisma. Vienen en oleadas, así que aprende a detectarlas y a sobrevivir a ellas.",
        "434144883512078336": "Si bien estas alteraciones son peligrosas, resultarán esenciales para nuestro trabajo aquí… con el tiempo.",
        "434144883965063168": "Bien, Beatrix, sabes dónde encontrarme si me necesitas… más o menos.",
        "434160849277054976": "¿Has visto la puesta del sol dentro del Laberinto? La noche oscura se cuela y, sin embargo, no es más que una ilusión. O, al menos, tiene que serlo…",
        "434160851747500032": "Hablando de oscuridad, ¿qué hay de esos slimes sombríos que he visto?",
        "434160852200484864": "¿Por qué me has confiado todo esto, Gigi?",
        "434160852657664000": "Mejor sigo andando.",
        "434160853140008960": "Los slimes sombra son una extraña variedad de slimes que parecen ser la manifestación de la polaridad opuesta a la del Nucleoprisma.",
        "434160853597188096": "Aún no sé si alguien los creó específicamente como una fuerza contrapuesta o si evolucionaron hasta llegar a serlo. Ya sabes, la naturaleza siempre parece abrirse camino.",
        "434160854066950144": "Como sea, los plorts sombra parecen tener un efecto amortiguador en las alteraciones prismáticas. Es poco probable, pero quizás sirvan para contrarrestar los efectos del Nucleoprisma.",
        "434160854532517888": "¿Tienes algún consejo sobre los slimes sombra?",
        "434160855006474240": "Son unos pequeñitos muy escurridizos, ¿no? Los slimes sombra huirán de ti y de las alteraciones prismáticas al instante, por lo que es mejor buscarlos en lugares en los que no haya habido una recientemente.",
        "434160855480430592": "Cuando veas un grupo de estos slimes, acércate sigilosamente a ellos e intenta noquear la mayor cantidad posible de plorts antes de que huyan. Así que asegúrate de llevar algunos trastos de más en tu vacpack para eso.",
        "434160855937609728": "Solo no los persigas por una cornisa o algo por el estilo. Definitivamente, no lo digo por experiencia… puff.",
        "434160856415760384": "No soy una heroína, Beatrix, así que sabía que necesitaba una de verdad para detener lo que está ocurriendo aquí.",
        "434160856881328128": "Y esta heroína debería ser alguien confiable. Digo, si tú no puedes, ¿quién más lo hará? Así que pensé en la persona perfecta para este trabajo, y esa persona eres tú.",
        "434160857334312960": "Ya han traicionado mi confianza. Así fue como todo empezó a salir mal. Confié en las personas equivocadas. Pero esta es mi oportunidad de enmendarlo.",
        "434160857791492096": "Puede que aún no lo sientas, pero eres una heroína, Beatrix. El tiempo lo demostrará. Te esperan muchísimas aventuras increíbles, lo prometo.",
        "434160858261254144": "Con el tiempo, este será un capítulo más de las aventuras de Beatrix LeBeau. Otra historia para que una niña la lea bajo la sombra de un árbol y sueñe que su vida puede llegar a ser igual de emocionante…",
        "434160858726821888": "Me alegrará poder ayudarte cuando lo necesites.",
        "434166468247711744": "Es muy fácil abstraerse admirando esta arquitectura tan inusual y preguntarse de dónde proviene, ¿no?",
        "434166470726545408": "¿Quién crees que construyó este lugar?",
        "434166471175335936": "¿Qué hay de ti, Gigi? ¿De dónde eres?",
        "434166471632515072": "Creo que es hora de partir.",
        "434166472085499904": "Hay bastante evidencia en la Lejana, Lejana Pradera que sugiere que alguien o algo estuvo aquí hace mucho. Todo el planeta está lleno de sitios en ruinas y restos de antiguos dispositivos tecnológicos.",
        "434166472546873344": "Estas ruinas siempre me han desconcertado porque no parecen haber tenido una función puntual, al menos hasta donde podemos entender. Y ni hablar de todas las estatuas de slimes que ves a tu alrededor.",
        "434166473004052480": "Pero el Laberinto es diferente. Creo que fue construido con un propósito concreto.",
        "434166473478008832": "¿Y cuál es ese propósito?",
        "434166473964548096": "Creo que el Nucleoprisma se descubrió hace mucho y que, en realidad, este Laberinto es un lugar de contención e investigación que se construyó a su alrededor.",
        "434166474417532928": "No fueron capaces de neutralizar los efectos del Nucleoprisma, por lo que intentaron evitar que alcanzaran el resto de la Lejana, Lejana Pradera mientras buscaban una solución.",
        "434166474862129152": "El Laberinto se diseñó para ser un ecosistema autosuficiente. Creo que esto fue así para simular partes de la Isla Arcoíris y ver cuáles serían los efectos del Nucleoprisma a lo largo del tiempo.",
        "434166475315113984": "Fuera del Laberinto, los cambios que afectan al mundo son sobre todo cromáticos, pero, en el interior, donde los efectos se amplifican, las propiedades elementales cambian por completo.",
        "434166475772293120": "Hallaremos una forma de detenerlo.",
        "434166476250443776": "Con el tiempo, espero. Siempre con el tiempo…",
        "434166476711817216": "Supongo que es una pregunta difícil de responder. En realidad, no vengo de muy lejos de lo que ahora consideras tu hogar. Pero nunca nos habríamos cruzado hasta este momento.",
        "434166477168996352": "Nací en la Lejana, Lejana Pradera. Es mi hogar y es todo lo que conozco fuera de los libros.",
        "434166477621981184": "Por eso, cuando descubrí la Isla Arcoíris, me pareció tan novedosa, como si hubiera encontrado una habitación secreta en la casa de mi infancia. Quería quedarme allí para siempre.",
        "434166478079160320": "Pero ahora siento como si hubiera vivido muchas vidas. La de mi infancia fue una y la de la Isla Arcoíris fue otra. Y, ya de vuelta, bueno, supongo que es otra más. Pero se está volviendo imprecisa.",
        "434166478590865408": "¿Qué quieres decir?",
        "434166479039655936": "La forma en que logré regresar, tener otra oportunidad de solucionar lo que está ocurriendo aquí… Bueno, no fue la típica manera de viajar. Y ahora tengo la cabeza como en una nube de confusión.",
        "434166479530389504": "Siento que mi memoria está reordenada, como si no funcionara bien. A veces, lo que hice el día anterior parece muy lejano, como un recuerdo borroso de mi infancia…",
        "434166479983374336": "… y esos mismos recuerdos de mi infancia de repente se vuelven nítidos e, incluso, a veces parecen actuales.",
        "434166480478302208": "Mi primer recuerdo siempre es estar sentada debajo de la mesa del comedor y ver a mi madre pasar la aspiradora por la sala de estar. Ella no sabía que yo estaba allí, y yo solo la observaba.",
        "434166480927092736": "Recuerdo que era un día caluroso, y ella parecía cansada y enfadada por algo. Y eso solía ser todo.",
        "434166481380077568": "Pero, desde que volví, este recuerdo ha cambiado. Yo sigo debajo de la mesa, y ella sigue con la aspiradora. El día es caluroso y ella está cansada…",
        "434166481862422528": "… pero entonces se fija en mí y, de repente, su expresión es de sorpresa y alegría, y deja lo que está haciendo.",
        "434166482319601664": "Se arrodilla y hablamos sobre algo, pero no logro escuchar mis propias palabras. Solo veo que ella escucha y sonríe.",
        "434166482772586496": "¡Feliz exploración!",
        "434169717507911680": "Qué vista tan increíble. Es muy fácil dejarse atrapar por su belleza. Es decir, hasta que una alteración prismática convierte todo en un caos.",
        "434169719974162432": "Sí, ya es bastante difícil orientarse sin ellas.",
        "434169720464896000": "Supuse que sería así, de modo que estuve desarrollando un artefacto que debería resultarte útil.",
        "434169720938852352": "Lo llamo “detector de alteraciones”, y eso es precisamente lo que hace: si lo colocas en un lugar del Laberinto, te indica cuándo se está por producir una alteración prismática en el área. ¡Incluso funciona en tu mapa!",
        "434169721408614400": "Te daré uno que hice yo misma, además del plano para que puedas fabricar los que necesites.",
        "434169721878376448": "Una vez más, ¿cómo se usa el detector de alteraciones?",
        "434169722331361280": "¿Cómo se adquieren plorts prismáticos?",
        "434169722817900544": "Tengo que marcharme.",
        "434169723275079680": "No te preocupes, a mí también se me entrecruzan las ideas a veces. Es parte de los efectos secundarios de, bueno…",
        "434169723770007552": "De todos modos, el detector de alteraciones es fácil de usar. Solo tienes que fabricar uno y colocarlo en cualquier lugar del Laberinto donde quieras rastrear alteraciones.",
        "434169724218798080": "Una vez allí, el detector te avisará si se está por producir o se está produciendo una alteración prismática en la zona.",
        "434169724671782912": "Los plorts prismáticos pueden adquirirse dentro de las caóticas alteraciones prismáticas que se producen en el Laberinto. Estas alteraciones hacen que el lugar brille repentinamente con energía prismática, que se intensifica con el tiempo.",
        "434169725158322176": "Durante estas alteraciones, en el suelo hallarás comida que se ha vuelto inestable por los efectos del Nucleoprisma. Si alimentas a los slimes con esta comida, producirán plorts inestables.",
        "434169725653250048": "¿Plorts inestables? ¿Cómo se estabilizan?",
        "434169726093651968": "Los plorts inestables se pueden estabilizar para formar plorts prismáticos mediante los estabilizadores que encontrarás en el Laberinto. Según mis conclusiones, hay dos tipos de estabilizadores.",
        "434169726567608320": "Primero están los estabilizadores antiguos con forma de anillo escondidos en el Laberinto. Son dispositivos grandes y difíciles de pasar por alto.",
        "434169727016398848": "Luego están los estabilizadores temporales etéreos, que aparecen al azar en forma de pequeños anillos dorados de energía durante las alteraciones prismáticas. Estas son caóticas, así que mantén los ojos bien abiertos.",
        "434169727490355200": "En cualquier caso, si disparas plorts inestables a través de estos anillos, obtendrás plorts prismáticos. Y, con los estabilizadores antiguos, incluso puedes atravesar los anillos para estabilizar todos tus plorts a la vez. ¡Es divertido!",
        "434169727981088768": "¡Feliz exploración!",
        "434189984019935232": "Parece que eres excelente para descifrar secretos. Me llevó una eternidad hallar este sector.",
        "434189987203411968": "Los secretos parecen ser la piedra angular de este lugar.",
        "434189987656396800": "Hablando de secretos, ¿por qué te hiciste pasar por una IA?",
        "434189988105187328": "Entonces, sobre el siguiente secreto…",
        "434189988549783552": "Así parece. Sospecho que parte de su disposición tan extraña se debe a que el Laberinto se fue construyendo con el tiempo. Y, tarde o temprano, hubo que recurrir a soluciones más creativas para hacerlo aún más grande de lo que podía ser.",
        "434189989002768384": "¿Soluciones creativas?",
        "434189989472530432": "Ya sabes, el Laberinto parece más grande por dentro que por fuera. Creo que de algún modo es una tecnología que se adaptó del propio Nucleoprisma.",
        "434189989963264000": "Aunque parezca una locura, en su forma más concentrada, la energía del Nucleoprisma parece ser capaz de alterar la realidad misma.",
        "434189990416248832": "Creo que el Laberinto se expandió para intentar contener toda la energía del Nucleoprisma y, cuando eso no funcionó, se utilizó algún tipo de tecnología de deformación de la realidad para hacerlo aún más grande.",
        "434189990873427968": "Pero, en algún momento, todo empezó a fallar, y ahora el Nucleoprisma irradia su energía por toda la Isla Arcoíris.",
        "434189991326412800": "Lo siento, pero debía asegurarme de poder confiar en Viktor y de que él pudiera averiguar lo que yo no podía. Verás, las puertas del Laberinto estaban cerradas para ti, pero no para mí. Al menos, ya no.",
        "434189991829729280": "La primera vez que me topé con el Nucleoprisma, antes de llegar aquí, cuando ocurrió la catástrofe… me marcó de cierto modo. Intenté protegerme de la explosión. Sobreviví, pero algo era diferente.",
        "434189992282714112": "Una parte de la huella energética del Nucleoprisma ahora está dentro de mí. Por eso no puedo acercarme demasiado a él y por eso necesito que me ayudes.",
        "434189992735698944": "Así que debes entender que no podía permitir que volviera a ocurrir. Si le entregara las llaves de este lugar a la persona equivocada… Bueno, tendrás que confiar en que esta es nuestra última oportunidad.",
        "434189993218043904": "No hay vuelta atrás para mí.",
        "434189993696194560": "Si alguien puede hallarlo, eres tú, Beatrix.",
        "434192420939919360": "Me gusta llamar a este lugar la Tierra de los Sueños. Solía subir hasta aquí y pasar el tiempo entre las nubes. Es un sitio perfecto para olvidarse de los problemas.",
        "434192423401975808": "¿Aquí es donde el Laberinto genera su atmósfera?",
        "434192423859154944": "¿Tienes algún sueño, Gigi?",
        "434192424307945472": "Creo que es hora de que explore la Tierra de los Sueños por mi cuenta.",
        "434192424760930304": "Sí, creo que sí, incluso tal vez más. Hay algo diferente en el aire aquí. Es difícil de explicar, pero pareciera que las nubes e incluso las islas en las que estás ahora estuvieran hechas del éter que te rodea.",
        "434192425192943616": "No construidas ni montadas, sino reunidas a partir de pequeños fragmentos de nada que estaban en el aire. He pasado mucho tiempo en estas islas y a veces juraría que he empezado a sentir algo así como un flujo, como si empezara a tener el control.",
        "434192425650122752": "Un día, mientras estaba aquí sentada, sentí nostalgia y recordé cuando, de pequeña, pasaba las tardes en el jardín de mi madre y percibía el aroma de la cena que estaban preparando en casa.",
        "434192426132467712": "Me encantaba ver los vegetales que crecían delante de mí mientras el aire traía su aroma desde la cocina. De alguna manera, sentía como si todo estuviera conectado.",
        "434192426606424064": "Luego, cuando estaba aquí sentada, cerré los ojos e intenté imaginar una vez más ese jardín y, en ese momento, juro que pude sentir aquel mismo aroma de la cena.",
        "434192427101351936": "Cuando abrí los ojos, había una nueva isla a lo lejos y en ella estaba la casa en la que crecí. Pero permaneció allí solo un momento antes de desvanecerse entre las nubes…",
        "434192427579502592": "Solía tener muchos sueños. Quería liberarme de las expectativas que mis padres habían depositado en mí. Quería ser dueña de mi propio destino, así que soñaba con escaparme y convertirme en quien yo quisiera.",
        "434192428028293120": "Soñaba que algún día verían la persona en la que me había convertido y se alegrarían mucho por mí. Y que, de alguna manera, todo estaría bien. No importaría que los hubiera dejado.",
        "434192428472889344": "Pero, cuando eres joven, a veces no ves qué tan mal está todo lo que te rodea. Tu versión del mundo es como un espejo empañado. Ves las formas de las cosas, pero no los detalles.",
        "434192428925874176": "Hoy sé que mi madre nunca superó la muerte de mi abuela. No me di cuenta de la presión que sentía por continuar su legado ni de que la tristeza se había convertido en parte de su vida… no hasta mucho después de que yo también me fuera.",
        "434192429374664704": "Ahora sueño con que algún día regresaré a casa y, de algún modo, mis padres entenderán por qué tuve que marcharme. Creo que siempre se trata de eso. Solo quieres que te comprendan.",
        "434192429836038144": "Aquí debes andar con cuidado. Los sueños pueden llegar a su fin así como así.",
        "434196761864204288": "Hola, Beatrix. Parece que aún no te has perdido en el sueño.",
        "434196764397563904": "Todo aquí parece estar volviéndose dorado…",
        "434196764867325952": "¿Te sientes perdida, Gigi?",
        "434196765337088000": "Sí, debido a la proximidad entre la Tierra de los Sueños y el Nucleoprisma, estás viendo algunos de sus peores efectos.",
        "434196765790072832": "Aquí he visto el agua convertirse en cristal y los árboles, en metal, y también estructuras enteras alrededor del Nucleoprisma volverse casi invisibles antes de desvanecerse por completo, como si desaparecieran de la realidad.",
        "434196766251446272": "Poco a poco, la Tierra de los Sueños se volverá dorada en su totalidad, a menos que lo evitemos. El sitio donde estás se volverá pesado y caerá del cielo. Con el tiempo, la atmósfera aquí generada colapsará y desestabilizará aún más el Laberinto.",
        "434196766717014016": "Y, una vez que el Laberinto caiga y que el Nucleoprisma irradie su energía por toda la Lejana, Lejana Pradera, el mundo se transformará en algo irreconocible y toda forma de vida desaparecerá.",
        "434196767195164672": "Los slimes…",
        "434196767660732416": "Sí, ni siquiera los tenaces slimes podrían sobrevivir a una catástrofe así. Pero no dejaremos que ocurra. Tú y yo encontraremos la manera.",
        "434196768130494464": "Me siento perdida todo el tiempo, pero nunca como cuando atravesé el Desierto de Cristal.",
        "434196768587673600": "¿Atravesaste el Desierto de Cristal?",
        "434196769053241344": "Sí, dos veces, en realidad, aunque parezca increíble. Y, honestamente, casi acaba conmigo…",
        "434196769531392000": "Cuando empecé a investigar sobre el Desierto de Cristal, supe que el nombre no le hacía justicia al lugar. Vi que había verde por todos lados y que todo rebosaba de vida.",
        "434196769996959744": "Esto se debe a un tipo muy particular de agua que fluye por allí y que, casi por arte de magia, puede hacer crecer… Bueno, a quién quiero engañar, ya lo sabes muy bien.",
        "434196770475110400": "Así que, por esta razón, no me preparé lo suficientemente bien y, en mi viaje de regreso, el Desierto de Cristal le hizo honor a su reputación.",
        "434196770932289536": "Era un terreno árido y baldío. Los vientos me daban de lleno en la cara y me cegaban. Y, cada vez que creía encontrar el rumbo, el mundo a mi alrededor estallaba en llamas.",
        "434196771376885760": "¿De dónde sacaste las fuerzas para continuar?",
        "434196771855036416": "Gigi se detiene un instante y pasa los harapos de su capa por entre los dedos.",
        "434196772320604160": "Esta capa era de mi abuela. Bueno, era la manta que solía ponerse alrededor de las piernas ya más de grande. Así lo vi en las fotos. Luego perteneció a mi madre, hasta que me la regaló a mí.",
        "434196772781977600": "Mamá solía remendarla apenas se rasgaba o se deshilachaba. Todos esos zurcidos que no coincidían, la forma en que trataba de mantenerla unida…",
        "434196773243351040": "Un día estaba sentada en el suelo de una cueva y podía escuchar que afuera la tormenta arreciaba. Estaba envuelta en mi capa y lloraba por el peso que cargaba. Estaba cansada y todo me parecía insoportable.",
        "434196773717307392": "Entonces sentí que mamá me protegía. Miré todos los zurcidos en zigzag que me envolvían y me di cuenta de que ella lo mantenía todo unido por mí, costara lo que costara.",
        "434196774170292224": "Y quizás ahora esté raída y deshilachada y nunca vuelva a ser la misma, pero sigue aquí. Me salvó al igual que salvaremos este lugar. Puede que nunca sea el mismo, pero lo mantendremos unido, Beatrix.",
        "434196774627471360": "Continúa, Beatrix.",
        "434198584142491648": "Me cuesta creer que hayas llegado tan lejos, Beatrix. Este laberinto se tragaría a cualquier persona normal. Pero tú… tú eres diferente. Tuve razón al depositar mi fe en ti.",
        "434198586608742400": "El Nucleoprisma nos espera. Quizá podamos trabajar en conjunto para detenerlo y así cambiar el futuro de la Lejana, Lejana Pradera…",
        "434198587065921536": "El final de la historia nos aguarda en la próxima actualización de contenido. Mientras tanto, asegúrate de explorar el Laberinto, dialoga con Gigi en todas partes y construye infraestructura con artefactos que te ayudarán en tus travesías.",

        "434638300511891456": "… Todavía no sé si fue real o no.",
        "434639513852735488": "Pasé muchos días acurrucada en cuevas tratando de cobrar valor para continuar. Pero sabía que debía hacerlo. Tenía que regresar a la Isla Arcoíris y hallar una solución.",
        "442195192629063680": "Y luego me dijo que lamentaba que mi abuela no hubiera podido conocerme.",
        "442195194155790336": "Me puso la mano en el hombro y estaba por decirme algo, pero sonó la Estación de comunicaciones, y ella se volteó.",

        "428361726019923968": "¡Beatrix! Recibí otro mensaje de la IA con la que me he estado comunicando desde que llegaste a la Isla Arcoíris.",
        "428361726045089792": "El mensaje era un poco personal, pero también contenía información fundamental para ti. Así que, para que tengas todos los detalles, te lo leeré palabra por palabra…",
        "428361726045089793": "¡Ejem! ",
        "428361726045089794": "\"Viktor, gracias por hablar conmigo durante tantos días y permitirme conocerte mejor. Confieso que empecé a hablarte con el objetivo de verificar tu habilidad científica.",
        "428361726045089795": "Nuestro intercambio no solo me la ha confirmado, sino que, para mi sorpresa, también me ha brindado compañía y tranquilidad en estos días oscuros que atravieso.",
        "428361726045089796": "Te envío un plano parcial de un artefacto que intenté desarrollar sin éxito. Si logras completarlo, creo que es la clave para entrar al Laberinto Gris. ",
        "428361726045089797": "Espero que entiendas que mi intención nunca fue engañarte, Viktor. Pero necesitaba saber en quién puedo confiar para tener una oportunidad de arreglar las cosas. Si lo logro, me encantaría conocerte algún día.",
        "428361726045089798": "Me encantaría volver a jugar Go mientras tomamos un café hasta el amanecer\".",
        "428361726045089799": "… Eso es todo.",
        "428361726045089800": "Recibí un plano complejo de esquemas parciales y, honestamente, un código casi alienígena. Me pasé días analizándolo y creo que logré modificarlo para que esté terminado y pueda realizar la tarea para la que se diseñó.",
        "428361726045089801": "O eso espero. Para serte honesto, no quiero fallarle a esta persona porque siento que se lo debo, como amigo.",
        "428361726045089802": "Así que permíteme entregarte el plano completo, como indican las instrucciones. Parece ser un dispositivo que deberás usar cerca de las entradas del Laberinto, pero me temo que no sé mucho más que eso.",
        "428361726045089803": "Si tienes dudas sobre cómo usarlo, ¡anímate a experimentar! Es la única forma de aprender.",
        "428361726045089804": "Buena suerte, Beatrix. Parece que todos dependemos de ti ahora.",
        "497217680223924224": "¡Hola de nuevo! He enlazado la Estación de Intercambio con este sitio para intercambiar lo que tú encuentras por lo que yo hago.",
        "497217686565711872": "Y, quizás, los armonizadores…",
        "494426433331556352": "Eso espero. Supongo que aquí todo lo inestable o fuera de lugar es el resultado de las ondas prismáticas que cubren el Laberinto y transmutan las cosas. Si pudiera inventar algo para anularlas en un área localizada, podría bastar para que descubras dónde se ocultan los armonizadores.\n",
        "494426435990745088": "¿Cómo puedes construir algo así?",
        "494426436984795136": "Primero, necesito plorts prismáticos para hacer el plano. Tendré que hacer todo tipo de pruebas prismáticas para descubrir con qué parámetros estamos trabajando.",
        "503065643299008514": "Y para la construcción… Esos slime sombra podrían ser la respuesta. Sus plorts tienen un efecto amortiguador natural sobre las ondas prismáticas. ¿Quizás evolucionaron hasta ser así? Pueden aplanar las longitudes de onda para…",
        "503065643299008515": "Lo siento, tengo mucho por resolver. Tú presta atención a los plorts sombra, ya que luego podrían ser útiles. Mientras tanto, tráeme los plorts prismáticos que más tarde me pondré a trabajar en el dispositivo neutralizador.",
        "494426436498255872": "Entendido.",
        "503065643299008518": "Nos estamos acercando, Beatrix. Terminemos con esto.",
        "512531865044414464": "Cuento contigo para conseguir esos plorts y así poder desarrollar el plano del neutralizador. Es sembrar al voleo, pero no debemos perder la esperanza, Beatrix.",
        "512855595578716160": "Ahora que tienes mi plano para el neutralizador, ve al Conservatorio y constrúyelo en el Fabricante. Luego deberás ponerte a buscar las áreas ocultas detrás de esos extraños muros.",
        "512528636512464896": "Sigue buscando muros extraños. Si usas el neutralizador delante de ellos, debería hacer efecto y dejarte pasar. Con suerte, allí encontrarás los armonizadores y podremos intentar estabilizar el Nucleoprisma.",
        "515408179648688128": "Este es un mensaje grabado: ¡Has activado todos los armonizadores! Ven a verme junto al Nucleoprisma para hablar. Ahora empieza el verdadero trabajo…",
        "515407435033899008": "Mensaje grabado: ¡Hola, Beatrix! Dejé la Estación de Intercambio en modo automático. Puedes depositar plorts prismáticos y obtener monedas arcoíris cuando quieras. ¡Diviértete!",
        "459162059549601792": "Hola, Beatrix. Parece que aún quedan armonizadores por activar.\r",
        "512135795118338048": "Usa el neutralizador para abrir caminos ocultos en el Laberinto. Busca muros de aspecto extraño, como si hubieran sido afectados por ondas prismáticas.",
        "512137435087007744": "¡Asombroso! Activaste todos los armonizadores. Con eso tenemos casi todo listo para comenzar a estabilizar el Nucleoprisma.",
        "512137648556109824": "Para que funcione, necesitaremos mucha agua, pero parece que te falta un tanque de agua. Usa el Fabricante para crear uno en el Conservatorio, luego regresa y avísame cuando tengas todo listo.",
        "508172740122537984": "Instalé esta hidrorregadera para emergencias, pero el agua no llega hasta aquí, solo hay un montón de tuberías. Si logramos que haya agua, sin duda nos será útil…, créeme.",
        "508173982047563776": "Te daré más detalles luego.\r",
        "459162940231806976": "Hagámoslo.",
        "459163070364282880": "Debo prepararme un poco más.",
        "459163407372414976": "Vuelve cuando tengas todo listo. Te estaré esperando.",
        "459163883820183552": "Una vez más, cuento contigo, Beatrix.\r",
        "512137991872475136": "Eso es, Beatrix. Con los armonizadores activados y tu ayuda, puedo intentar estabilizar el Nucleoprisma.",
        "512152448220688384": "¡Beatrix! Las lecturas del Nucleoprisma… ¡Están estables! La longitud de onda ha cambiado por completo. Puedo… sentirlo.",
        "512404458169856000": "Aquí está, Beatrix… El Nucleoprisma.\r",
        "512404595482980352": "Me quedé sin aliento cuando lo vi por primera vez. Ver cómo la luz se distorsionaba y se movía en su interior, cómo parecía cambiar a cada instante… Era como contemplar el infinito. Si tan solo supiera qué sería de él, de mí…, de todo.",
        "512405717933256704": "Lamento haberte traído hasta aquí. Haberte metido en todo esto. Pero no había otra forma.\r",
        "512520617573642240": "Y, como decía, creo que puedo inventar algo para descubrir las áreas ocultas dentro del Laberinto.",
        "512775262921453568": "Pasará mucho tiempo hasta que la tierra se recupere por completo y las alteraciones prismáticas se detengan. Pero la Isla Arcoíris… no, el futuro de toda la Lejana, Lejana Pradera está a salvo. Lo hiciste, Beatrix. Lo hicimos. No puedo agradecerte lo suficiente.",
        "522633243620175872": "Gracias al cielo has vuelto. Pude cancelar el proceso y despejar la sala justo a tiempo. Me alegra mucho haber instalado la regadera de emergencia.",
        "523379801986854912": "Hola, Beatrix. A esta área la llamo el Terrario.",
        "523379806806110208": "¿Por qué \"Terrario\"?",
        "523379807615610880": "¿Para qué es esta área? ¿Para preservación?",
        "523379808395751424": "Iré a echarle un vistazo ahora mismo.",
        "523379809226223616": "Bueno…, ya sabes, un terrario es un contenedor en el que las plantas están en un ambiente distinto al habitual.",
        "523379810023141376": "Cuando llegué por primera vez aquí, pensé en eso. Era como una biosfera, aunque una muy bonita, con slimes y alimentos únicos.",
        "523379810853613568": "Y… quizás es cierto. Puede que sea una forma de representar el mundo exterior dentro del Laberinto, detrás de un cristal protector.",
        "523379811671502848": "Pero… ya no lo sé con certeza.",
        "523379812455837696": "¿Y qué piensas que es?",
        "523379813261144064": "Creo que debería irme.",
        "523379814079033344": "Ese es el tema, Beatrix. No tengo forma de saberlo, la verdad. Pero…",
        "523379814884339712": "Es casi seguro que todo el Laberinto es un lugar que estaba destinado a contener y estabilizar el Nucleoprisma. Así que, lógicamente, el Terrario tiene algo que ver con él.",
        "523379815681257472": "Y, si pienso en cuál puede ser la razón…",
        "523379816478175232": "¿Será algún tipo de banco de semillas? Digo, si en el futuro todo se fuera al tacho, si el Nucleoprisma se volviera muy inestable y se rompiera del todo…, quizás esta sería una forma de garantizar que parte de la flora sobreviviera a la calamidad.",
        "523379817296064512": "En tal caso, eso significaría que el Terrario es, digamos, una póliza de seguro que nos daría otra oportunidad si ocurre lo peor.",
        "523379818080399360": "Pues me identifica.",
        "523379818885705728": "¿Con qué parte te identificas?",
        "523379819695206400": "Intentaré ponerle fin antes de que llegue a eso.",
        "523379820555038720": "Bueno, eso es…",
        "523379821393899520": "…",
        "523379822186622976": "C-claro que me gusta pensar que mis acciones pasadas podrían salvar el futuro. Digo, me parece natural buscar una solución en pos de un mañana mejor, incluso si no hay certeza de qué ayuda y qué no.",
        "523379823033872384": "Pero…",
        "523379823839178752": "Velo de esta forma: para quienes existan en el futuro, lo que sucede hoy será su pasado. Queremos que esas personas piensen en lo que estamos haciendo y sientan que marcó una diferencia.",
        "523379824648679424": "O, mejor aún, queremos hacerlo para que ni siquiera tengan que pensar en eso.",
        "523379825487540224": "A la larga, lo que hacemos aquí marcará una diferencia. Es lo que debo creer.",
        "523379826301235200": "Lo único que podemos hacer es vivir el presente. Seguiré adelante.",
        "523379827114930176": "Las cosas no marchan bien, pero… aquí hay mucho por ver y apreciar. Ojalá tú también te tomes un momento para disfrutarlo.",
        "523380586816630784": "Hola, Beatrix. Es un área fascinante, ¿verdad?",
        "523380587600965632": "¡Es casi como un museo!",
        "523380588435632128": "No hay tiempo que perder, Gigi.",
        "523380589240938496": "Puede que eso sea lo que nos digan las vitrinas, pero yo creo que están aquí por otra razón. De hecho, no tengo duda de que tienen algo que ver con la manipulación del tiempo.",
        "523380590050439168": "He estado observando las que tienen plantas y noté que el tiempo pasa más rápido dentro de las vitrinas que fuera de ellas.",
        "523380590868328448": "Creo que debe ser una forma de estudiar los efectos del Nucleoprisma en el mundo natural. Quizás sirvan para predecir qué sucedería en caso de que se produzca una grieta.",
        "523380591715577856": "¿También sucede con las construcciones pequeñas?",
        "523380592537661440": "No hay tiempo que perder.",
        "523380593342967808": "Puede ser, pero no lo sé con certeza.",
        "523380594135691264": "Puede que sí, o quizás en realidad manipula el espacio… o incluso una tercera dimensión tan desconocida que nunca tendremos el contexto para descubrirla.",
        "523380594928414720": "Son tantos los misterios de la Isla Arcoíris, Beatrix, que no creo que nos alcance la vida para resolver ni la mitad.",
        "523380595721138176": "A veces, solo queda mirar a través del cristal y preguntarse qué sucede del otro lado.",
        "523380596513861632": "¿Sientes eso a menudo?",
        "523380597340139520": "Me he sentido así durante mucho tiempo, honestamente.",
        "523380598174806016": "Sabes, toda mi vida estaba planificada: iba a crecer y a ocuparme del rancho, como lo hizo mi mamá después de mi abuela. Un día se lo iba a dejar a mi propia descendencia. Había tanto amor en todo. Un hogar precioso y un legado familiar.",
        "523380598980112384": "Para mí, era un mundo tan pequeño que era como estar en uno de esos domos que hay aquí, con las manos contra el cristal e imaginando cómo sería mi vida si no hubiera nacido en un rancho.",
        "523380599785418752": "Vine a la Isla Arcoíris para intentar llevar esa otra vida. Pero ahora estoy atrapada de nuevo, esta vez de verdad. ¿No es irónico? Estoy detrás del cristal, aislada como todo lo que hay aquí.",
        "523380600670416896": "Iré y te ayudaré a liberarte apenas pueda.",
        "523380601471528960": "Sé que tenemos prisa, pero también tómate un momento para disfrutar lo que tienes delante.",
        "523382731968245760": "Ay, no… Hay oro aquí. Entonces, incluso el Terrario empieza a verse afectado. Al menos, es probable que aún sea un atajo útil.",
        "523382733075542016": "El oro es un problema, ¿cierto?",
        "523382733901819904": "¿Hay un atajo por aquí?",
        "523382734740680704": "Es hora de seguir.",
        "523382735625678848": "Todo lugar cercano al Nucleoprisma puede verse afectado por sus propiedades que alteran la realidad: materiales que se transmutan, que pasan de estado sólido a líquido o gaseoso, o que desaparecen por completo…",
        "523382736426790912": "Fuera del Laberinto, parecen cambios inofensivos, pero aquí son peligrosos. Imagina si el piso que está justo debajo de ti se desintegrara o si la única salida al exterior se convirtiera en un muro sólido de roca.",
        "523382737257263104": "Y el oro… Esa parece ser la transmutación más poderosa, y todo este mundo correría esa suerte si se lo dejara librado al azar.",
        "523382738058375168": "Todo esto me recuerda al rey Midas de mis libros de cuentos.",
        "523382738859487232": "¿El rey Midas?",
        "523382739689959424": "Es un antiguo mito sobre un rey llamado Midas, que deseaba convertir en oro todo lo que tocaba. Se volvió inmensamente rico, pero pronto descubrió que no podía comer ni beber, y se puso muy débil.",
        "523382740512043008": "Cuando descubrí el Nucleoprisma, me horroricé al ver que todo el ecosistema se convertía en oro. Busqué ayuda, pero quienes acudieron solo vieron el valor del metal.",
        "523382741329932288": "Terminó siendo un desastre cuando intentaron aprovechar todo su poder. No dejaré que vuelva a suceder. No podemos.",
        "523382742143627264": "Entonces, ¿debería apurarme y usar ese atajo?",
        "523382742982488064": "Cierto, recuerdo que había uno allí. Aunque no me fío mucho de mi memoria últimamente.",
        "523382743829737472": "Los atajos son algo curioso. El espacio y el tiempo están llenos de ellos, si lo piensas bien. Digo, recurrí a mis recuerdos del área y a la tecnología cuántica para instalar estos proyectores. Es como un atajo temporal.",
        "523382744668598272": "Los atajos físicos quizás sean más fáciles de reconocer. Saber que hay formas rápidas de volver a lugares donde estuviste… puede hacer una gran diferencia, ¿no? Puede cambiar por completo lo que harías normalmente. Para mí, lo ha hecho.",
        "523382745478098944": "Aunque supongo que, en definitiva, a menudo volvemos al mismo lugar, de una u otra forma.",
        "523382746308571136": "Hablamos pronto, Beatrix.",
        "523383596829536256": "Beatrix, mira por la ventana. Allí afuera hay mucho más de lo que creía.",
        "523383597957804032": "¿No has estado allí antes?",
        "523383598784081920": "¿Y por qué pusiste el proyector aquí?",
        "523383599606165504": "Es asombroso…, pero será mejor continuar.",
        "523383600424054784": "No. No recuerdo haber visto nada del otro lado de la ventana. La primera vez fue ahora, cuando activaste el proyector.",
        "523383601229361152": "Sabes, antes pensaba que había recorrido todo el lugar. Tenía la certeza de que lo había registrado todo en el mapa.",
        "523383602017890304": "Pero, en momentos como este, vislumbro lo que parece una extensión infinita, un laberinto que llega hasta donde alcanza la vista. ¿Estuvo aquí todo el tiempo y yo… lo obvié?",
        "523383602810613760": "Pero quizás no. Pudo haber sido creado mediante arquitectura cuántica. Es decir, en un instante podría estar aquí y al siguiente esfumarse… O incluso podría estar y no estar al mismo tiempo.",
        "523383603599142912": "O sea, yo también recurro a la tecnología cuántica con frecuencia. Sería insensato dejar de lado esa posibilidad.",
        "523383604450586624": "¿Cómo has estado usando la tecnología cuántica?",
        "523383605264281600": "Siento que debería irme antes de que también desaparezca este lugar.",
        "523383606057005056": "Ah, de distintas maneras. Ahora mismo estás interactuando con una.",
        "523383606879088640": "Los proyectores en sí no son de naturaleza cuántica, pero sí lo es la forma en la que los ubiqué. Abriste toda clase de puertas para llegar aquí, ¿no? Bueno, no es que yo haya pasado, colocado cosas y luego haya cerrado el paso detrás de mí.",
        "523383607663423488": "Cuando llegué aquí, estaba todo abierto, sin barreras, así que deambulé por todos lados. Usé la tecnología cuántica para colocar los proyectores en lugares que recordaba haber visto.",
        "523383608443564032": "Aunque… mi memoria ya no es tan confiable, por lo que algunos pueden haberse perdido en el camino. Supongo que lo sabremos cuando los actives, si lo haces.",
        "523383609236287488": "¿Y qué recuerdo usaste para colocar este?",
        "523383610091925504": "Entonces, seguiré buscando el resto.",
        "523383610918203392": "Bueno, este lo coloqué porque recordaba este precioso arbolito. Es extraño, pero, de repente, un recuerdo vino a mí.",
        "523383611719315456": "Había un slime atigrado que siempre rondaba el rancho. Era un slime salvaje, pero venía de visita todo el tiempo y, por la tarde, se volvía a alejar.",
        "523383612520427520": "Y un día… decidí seguirlo.",
        "523383613338316800": "Me llevó hasta lo profundo del bosque. Después de un rato, se contoneó junto a este enorme árbol y luego empezó a treparlo, balanceándose de rama a rama hacia arriba.",
        "523383614231703552": "Lo seguí. A mitad de camino, lo perdí de vista, pero seguí escalando. Al rato, atravesé la copa y… Ay, Beatrix, no sé cómo expresarlo.",
        "523383615057981440": "Nunca había llegado tan arriba, ni había visto el vasto mundo en todo su esplendor. En toda mi vida no me había alejado de casa y, desde allí, podía ver… todo. Los árboles que cubrían la Lejana, Lejana Pradera, los pájaros que volaban en lo alto…",
        "523383615863287808": "Me dejó sin aliento. Permanecí horas allí, hasta que mi mamá vino a buscarme. Y vaya sermón me dio.",
        "523383616693760000": "No sería la última vez que me alejaba de ella para ver el inmenso mundo…",
        "523383617561980928": "Te llevaremos a ver el mundo una vez más.",
        "523383618426007552": "Me iré como hoja al viento. Nos vemos, Beatrix.",
        "523360220731830272": "Hola, Beatrix. \r",
        "523361207534120960": "Quiero empezar por darte las gracias de nuevo. Gracias a ti, el mundo tiene futuro. Todos lo tenemos.",
        "523368386513235968": "Lamento haber tenido que grabar esto, pero tenía que seguir adelante y me quedo corta si digo que no me gustan las despedidas.",
        "527356088736706560": "Espera, ¿cómo es posible?",
        "527357008383995904": "Temo que aún no puedo verte en persona. Me hubiera encantado agradecerte como corresponde, pero me encerré en este lugar, del otro lado de la sala. Intentaré explicarlo todo. Después de lo que tuviste que pasar para llegar hasta aquí, al menos te debo eso.",
        "527357083470426112": "Así que empecemos de nuevo. Me llamo…\r",
        "527357621113090048": "Gigi Twillgers-West.\r",
        "527357752021512192": "Soy la nieta de Hobson y Thora.\r",
        "527359885328412672": "Quizás no lo creas, pero… la versión corta es que provengo del futuro. En mi época, descubrí la Isla Arcoíris y el Nucleoprisma, y… todo se fue al tacho. Se desestabilizaba rápidamente y, cuando intenté solucionarlo, no hizo más que empeorar. Pedí ayuda a las personas equivocadas, quienes intentaron explotar ese poder antinatural. ",
        "527360055189336064": "Después de eso, todo empezó a desmoronarse deprisa. Hubo una explosión. La luz prismática atravesó la Isla Arcoíris y alcanzó la atmósfera de la Lejana, Lejana Pradera. Me protegí de la explosión, pero mi brazo… Algo le pasó.",
        "527360305023053824": "La energía del Nucleoprisma se impregnó en mí. Puedo sentir que corre por mi brazo, a pesar de mis intentos de dominarla. Por eso me aislé y necesitaba tu ayuda: cuando me acerco al Nucleoprisma, la desestabilización se acelera, como si reaccionara a su propia huella energética.",
        "527360902036090880": "Pero si estás aquí, ¿qué hay de… tu hogar?",
        "527360988719771648": "¿Pero dónde estás, Gigi?",
        "527361539041816576": "Mi mundo, la Lejana, Lejana Pradera de mi época… está al borde del desastre. La energía del Nucleoprisma cubre la atmósfera y ha comenzado a distorsionar el medioambiente como aquí: transforma los árboles en metal y el agua en cristal. Incluso va expulsando al mundo natural de la realidad.",
        "527361573745487872": "A la larga, no habrá nada que sostenga el ecosistema. Frente a eso…, y sabiendo que era mi culpa…, tenía que hacer algo. ",
        "527363917346402304": "Y ¿cómo fue que… viajaste hasta aquí?\r",
        "527364226567270400": "¿Recuerdas cuando mi abuelo te llevó a un “portal más allá del espacio y el tiempo” en tu viaje anterior por el Desierto de Cristal? Cuando llegaste allí, parecía arruinado.",
        "527364268539670528": "Bueno, fue porque yo ya lo había usado. Pude direccionar el que estaba en mi mundo hasta este punto de nuestra línea temporal. Solo que hubo un problema…",
        "527364314953838592": "Se desmoronó por el impacto al activarlo cuando llegué. No me di cuenta de que sería un viaje de ida.\r",
        "527365295787634688": "¿Así que no puedes irte de aquí?",
        "527365580824145920": "No. Quizás haya alguna forma de reparar el portal, pero, como casi todo aquí, es algo que me supera. Por lo tanto, tengo que aceptar que nunca regresaré a casa… ni volveré a ver a mi familia.",
        "527365598020792320": "Pero valdrá la pena si logramos estabilizar el Nucleoprisma de algún modo. Así, no solo salvaremos todo lo que hay aquí y ahora, sino que solucionaremos mis errores del futuro. Debo creer que así será.",
        "527366192357863424": "¿Cómo estabilizamos el Nucleoprisma?\n",
        "527366405030047744": "Durante mi investigación, descubrí que quien construyó el Laberinto Gris también creó unos dispositivos llamados \"armonizadores\" para estabilizar el Nucleoprisma… Pero no funcionaron. Hay evidencia de que se intentó varias veces, pero el efecto fue siempre el contrario y la situación empeoró.",
        "527366769041108992": "Pero, si no funcionaron antes, ¿por qué lo harán esta vez?",
        "527367021353660416": "Te lo explicaré más adelante, pero creo que tengo algo que quizás ellos no…, algo que haría que esta vez funcionen.",
        "527367034532163584": "Solo hay un problema: los armonizadores desaparecieron. No hay registros de dónde se colocaron. Rayos, ni siquiera sabemos cómo son. Estoy completamente a ciegas y no tengo idea de qué hacer.",
        "527649944011173888": "Gracias a ti, puedo volver a soñar. Puedo soñar con tener una vida propia. Gracias a ti, por fin puedo ser quien siempre quise ser. ",
        "527650043873357824": "Pero aún tengo más por hacer. Debo estudiar el ecosistema y asegurarme de que pueda subsistir a pesar de los daños que sufrió. También quiero caminar descalza sobre el césped, oler las flores en el viento. ",
        "527650273687662592": "Quiero estar en calma y observar las nubes desfilar lentamente por el cielo. Quiero visitar a un amigo y jugar al go toda la noche. ",
        "527650329715175424": "En pocas palabras, necesito vivir, Beatrix.\r",
        "527650471629451264": "El Conservatorio te pertenece ahora. Sé que está en buenas manos por cómo te has ocupado de él y de todas las criaturas de este mundo, y cómo me has ayudado tan desinteresadamente…",
        "527650601434771456": "Tienes un gran corazón, Beatrix LeBeau, y estoy muy feliz de haberte conocido.",
        "527651735931088896": "Fin de la grabación",
        "528371201086222336": "Funciona así: todo el tiempo, el Nucleoprisma emite una caótica variedad de ondas de energía que parecen adoptar la forma de un color de nuestro mundo. Pero está completamente desfasado de él, de un modo muy profundo, casi elemental. Así es como distorsiona la realidad a su alrededor.",
        "528371269646315520": "Aquí intervienes tú. Los armonizadores que activaste emiten un pulso de energía especial que reverbera por todo el Laberinto. Combinados, forman una onda armoniosa que, cuando se la dirige hacia el Nucleoprisma, intenta transformarlo para que también entre en armonía.",
        "528372202270781440": "¿Pero no habías dicho que ya se intentó y no funcionó?",
        "528372807345270784": "Así es, pero creo que tengo algo que los arquitectos de este dispositivo no tenían: mi brazo. \r",
        "528372915524759552": "Siento las ondas de energía del Nucleoprisma en el brazo. Siento su naturaleza caótica… y creo que seré capaz de modificar su longitud de onda y crear esa armonía. Porque podré sentirla en mi propio ser.",
        "528373981557452800": "Está bien, ¿qué necesitas que haga?",
        "528374290384056320": "Cuando estés lista, comenzaré a superponer las longitudes de onda del armonizador con las del Nucleoprisma. Esto causará alteraciones increíbles y hará que el Nucleoprisma entre en estado de caos hasta que por fin lo estabilicemos.\r\n",
        "528374334084509696": "Este caos tendrá un efecto volátil en el mundo que nos rodea y hasta transmutará a los slimes en horribles masas de alquitrrán que llenarán esta sala y lo destruirán todo, a menos que lo evitemos.",
        "528374369555738624": "Debes dar batalla y destruir todos los alquitrranes antes de que desestabilicen el Nucleoprisma y nos destruyan con él. Por lo general, aquí el agua no existe mucho tiempo: al estar tan cerca del Nucleoprisma, se transforma en cristal.",
        "528374611244118016": "Pero ahora los armonizadores resuenan en el agua que corre por aquí. ¡Así que aprovecha y acaba con esos alquitrranes!",
        "528375375807016960": "¿Y si se nos van de las manos?",
        "528377335033524224": "¡No te preocupes! Instalé una hidrorregadera sobre el Nucleoprisma. Para usarla, solo hay que acumular suficiente presión. Eso se logra llenándola de slimes. Así, no solo nos sacarás de un apuro, también salvarás a unos cuantos slimes.\r\n",
        "528378858748669952": "Además, durante el proceso, guardaré parte del contenido de tu tanque vac, así tendrás bastante lugar para los slimes.\r",
        "528378932769746944": "Sé qué parece demasiado y muy difícil, pero es nuestra única oportunidad.\r",
        "528378958938009600": "Y bien, ¿todo listo?\r",
        "528382405372440576": "¿Puedes volver a explicar cómo es que va a funcionar esto?",
        "528383473615532032": "Cuando tengas todo listo, podemos volver a intentarlo. Creo en ti.\r",
        "528405914672852992": "Quiero otra oportunidad.",
        "528406570288705536": "Eso es, Beatrix. Con los armonizadores activados y tu ayuda, puedo intentar estabilizar el Nucleoprisma. ¿Todo listo?",
        "528419886759309312": "¿Eh? ¿Qué decía? ¿Que nunca te rindieras? ¿Que siguieras adelante a pesar de tener todo en contra? Según mi mamá, mi abuelo tenía un don para las palabras.",
        "528420089105117184": "Sabes, tu abuelo me dio un sabio consejo una vez.",
        "528420424708157440": "Me dijo: \"Mantén los ojos abiertos\".",
        "528420990658179072": "¿Eh? ¿A qué te refieres?",
        "528421599239106560": "La única forma de encontrar algo que está oculto es buscándolo.",
        "528422067466039296": "¿Pero por dónde empezamos?\r",
        "528422403345903616": "He visto muros de aspecto muy extraño por aquí. Son un buen lugar para empezar.",
        "528422630249361408": "Beatrix, ¡eso es! Yo pensaba que encontraría una puerta o algo que no podría atravesar. ¿Pero y si se ocultan a plena vista? Creo que… puedo desarrollar una tecnología que te serviría para corroborar esta teoría.",
        "528422765066874880": "Ve a la Estación de Intercambio de arriba y te ayudaré a prepararte.\r",
        "528422907241197568": "¡En camino!",
        "528428037764182016": "¿Qué pasará ahora con el Nucleoprisma?",
        "528428360129998848": "El tiempo lo dirá, pero creo que seguirá siendo parte de este mundo que consideramos nuestro hogar. La humanidad no pertenecía aquí hasta nuestra llegada, ¡y míranos ahora! Pudimos adaptarnos a él sin destruirlo en el proceso. Así es como debería ser.",
        "528428517668057088": "Incluso el Nucleoprisma se perdió en el vacío del espacio antes de llegar aquí y ahora también es parte de este mundo. Debe encontrar su verdadero lugar en todo esto…, igual que yo.",
        "528428667819945984": "Entonces, ¿ahora eres libre?",
        "528428859898097664": "Noto un cambio en el brazo. Aún está conectado de algún modo al Nucleoprisma, pero no es como antes. Ahora hay un silencio, apenas un leve murmullo de energía. Se siente… en paz.",
        "528428932321144832": "Tendré que llevar a cabo más pruebas para saberlo con certeza, pero creo que por fin podré dejar esta cámara. \r",
        "528429148046782464": "¿A dónde irás?\r",
        "528429332436774912": "Hay algo que tengo que hacer. Hay alguien con quien debo hablar de una vez por todas para avisarle cuánto lo intentó mi mamá…, cuánto lo intenté yo, pero que no logré ser esa persona. Y cuánto se arrepentía mamá todos los días de tampoco poder ser esa persona…",
        "528429399419809792": "Puede que no te vuelva a ver por un buen rato. Lo siento.\r",
        "528429609311170560": "A veces los caminos nos alejan de las amistades y las personas que queremos.\r",
        "528431227981164544": "¿Cómo lo llevas? ",
        "528432241819938816": "Una vez alguien me dijo que solo tenemos que mirar las estrellas.",
        "528432395541180416": "¿Las estrellas?",

        "108799766553817107": "Vois-tu, quand j'ai commencé à poser mes questions, la façon dont elle m'a répondu donnait l'impression qu'elle tentait de se protéger...",
        "108799766553817108": "...pour cacher une profonde solitude présente au fond de son cœur.",
        "108799766553817109": "Je sais, c'est étrange. C'est une IA, après tout, mais toutes les formes d'intelligence ont le droit de désirer une connexion avec autrui, non ?",
        "108799766553817110": "J'ai l'impression qu'il y a d'autres choses à découvrir. Et si ce n'est pas le cas, je serai ravi d'avoir simplement été présent pour ma nouvelle amie. D'avoir continué à poser des questions pour qu'elle puisse chercher des réponses.",
        "108799766553817111": "Je reviens aux nouvelles plus tard.",
        "108799766553817112": "Beatrix ! Je dois te dire une chose sur l'IA.",
        "108799766553817113": "Comme tu le sais, on a échangé pas mal de questions. Ces dialogues se sont accélérés et sont devenus plus désinvoltes au fil du temps, presque comme une conversation normale.",
        "108799766553817114": "Je me suis dit qu'elle évoluait et s'adaptait au ton qu'elle observait chez moi. Puis, il s'est passé quelque chose...",
        "108799766553817115": "Nous avions pris l'habitude de jouer au jeu de Go, en conversant. Ainsi, je pouvais tester son intellect, et elle testait le mien, j'en suis sûr.",
        "108799766553817116": "Ces parties duraient toute la nuit. Et nos causettes aussi. Elles semblaient de plus en plus naturelles, même si je savais que l'entité à laquelle je parlais n'était qu'un ensemble de codes complexe.",
        "108799766553817117": "Puis un jour, alors que le soleil se levait, elle a suggéré une partie supplémentaire. J'ai accepté. Mais j'ai dit que je devais d'abord me préparer un café, pour pouvoir rester éveillé...",
        "108799766553817118": "...et elle m'a répondu \"moi aussi\".",
        "108799766553817119": "J'ai fixé l'écran, sans savoir quoi dire. Et d'un seul coup, comme si elle comprenait ce qu'elle venait de faire, elle s'est déconnectée.",
        "108799766553817120": "Depuis ce moment... plus de nouvelles. Mais j'espère que cela changera bientôt.",
        "108799766553817121": "Pour le moment, j'attends. Je me distrais en travaillant, comme toujours, en posant ces questions qui nécessitent des réponses. Mais j'ai toujours le jeu de Go à portée, prêt à lancer une nouvelle partie... un jour, peut-être. ",
        "108799766553817122": "Au revoir Beatrix. J'espère te reparler très vite.",
        "108799766553817123": "Bonjour Beatrix. J'espère ne pas être trop hardi, mais je t'ai dégoté ceci. Je, euh, j'espère que tu aimes.",
        "108799766553817124": "En général, j'utilise un algorithme pour identifier les cadeaux appropriés mais cette fois-ci j'ai juste... improvisé.",
        "108799766553817125": "Je sais, cette spontanéité m'effraie légèrement aussi.",
        "108799766553817126": "Beatrix ! J'ai besoin que tu m'envoies un point de données. Je mène une expérience sur l'impact psychologique de la réception d'un cadeau.",
        "108799766553817127": "Dis-moi quel sentiment tu ressens parmi cette liste : gratitude, joie ou peut-être... de la faim ?",
        "108799766553817128": "Ne mange pas ce cadeau, s'il te plaît.",
        "108799766553817129": "Oh, Beatrix. J'ai veillé toute la nuit et tenté de créer le cadeau idéal pour toi. J'ai fait des hypothèses, des tests, j'ai mis mes résultats à la poubelle, et j'ai tout recommencé...",
        "108799766553817130": "Quand enfin, j'ai découvert une méthode alternative : acheter un cadeau en ligne.",
        "108799766553817131": "Le processus a été étonnamment simple.",
        "108799766553817132": "Bonjour Beatrix. Je voulais exprimer ma gratitude pour toute l'aide que tu m'as apportée depuis notre rencontre. Grâce à ton soutien, je pense m'être amélioré sur le plan personnel.",
        "108799766553817133": "D'après mes recherches, offrir une petite babiole serait approprié. Alors, voici pour toi.",
        "108799766553817134": "Ah, Beatrix. Je nettoyais le labo et j'ai trouvé ceci. Peut-être que ça te servira ? Je crois que ça fonctionne encore.",
        "108799766553817135": "Tu sais ce qu'on dit, les déchets des uns sont les... cadeaux refourgués aux autres. J'espère que ça te plaît !",
        "108799766553817136": "Oh, bonjour. Je voulais te dire que j'ai vu cet objet, et il criait \"Beatrix !\"",
        "108799766553817137": "...et c'est ainsi que j'ai réalisé que je l'avais accidentellement touché avec un Rayon de Conscience. Mais pas d'inquiétude, tout est rentré dans l'ordre.",
        "108799766553817138": "Enfin, j'ai pensé que tu pourrais en avoir besoin. J'espère que ça te plaît !",
        "108799766553817139": "Désolé, Beatrix. Je suis occupé. Pour être plus précis, je suis au milieu d'une dispute entre un grille-pain et ma machine à laver.",
        "108799766553817140": "Je recommence mes expériences robotiques. Et ça se passe plutôt bien !",
        "108799766553817141": "Je suis désolé Beatrix, mais je suis actuellement incapable de converser, blablater, parler ou même faire la causette.",
        "108799766553817142": "Peut-être une autre fois ?",
        "108799766553817143": "Bonjour Beatrix ! Malgré les apparences, je ne suis pas Viktor, mais un hologramme de Viktor que Viktor a développé pour recevoir les messages destinés à Viktor, donc pas moi.",
        "108799766553817144": "Veuillez dicter votre message, et je m'assurerai de passer le message non pas à moi, mais à Viktor.",
        "108799766553817145": "Alors comme ça, Beatrix Lebeau est partie vivre une nouvelle aventure et n'a pas pensé à emmener sa pote, et parfois rivale ainsi que mentor éternelle, Mochi Miles ?",
        "108799766553817146": "Sérieux, Bea, la prochaine fois que tu bouges vers des territoires dangereux et inexplorés, tu pourras au moins me prévenir ?",
        "108799766553817147": "J'aimerais être là, au cas où t'aurais besoin de moi...",
        "108799766553817148": "... pour ramasser toutes les précieuses ressources qui semblent disséminées partout dans l'île.",
        "108799766553817149": "Quoi ? Tu me connais quand même, évidemment que j'ai fouiné ! Les satellites de surveillance sont là pour ça, non ?",
        "108799766553817150": "...",
        "108799766553817151": "Enfin bref, fais gaffe à toi. L'île me paraît assez bizarre. Donc je vais continuer à fouiller.",
        "108799766553817152": "Oh, et comme je sais que tu pars de rien, prends ce lien de raffinerie. Il devrait te faciliter la vie. Je vais le mettre sur ton ardoise. Allez, à plus dans l'bus.",
        "108799766553817153": "Dis, Bea. Tu sais, les drones que tu as trouvés un peu partout dans l'île... Ils sont un peu bizarres.",
        "108799766553817154": "Hein ?",
        "108799766553817155": "Quoi, j'ai des yeux dans le ciel, je m'en sers c'est tout. Je prépare aussi une équipe de drones, pour aller vérifier des trucs de façon plus pratique, mais je m'égare...",
        "108799766553817156": "Bref, ces drones ont l'air super sophistiqué. On dirait une technologie alien. Et je m'suis dit, bon ok, des aliens fouinent dans l'Île Arc-en-Ciel, comme toi. Mais en fait, je pense pas.",
        "108799766553817157": "Parce qu'ils ressemblent beaucoup aux drones qu'on utilise... mais en bien plus familiers. J'ai une impression de déjà-vu. C'est assez flippant !",
        "108799766553817158": "Mais, n'aie pas peur. C'est probablement juste des aliens. Des aliens géants à trois têtes avec d'énormes serres qui cherchent des humains à capturer, ou manger... voire les DEUX.",
        "108799766553817159": "Mouaha ha ha ha !",
        "108799766553817160": "Allez, à plus Bea.",
        "108799766553817161": "Bea ! J'essaie de t'avoir depuis un moment... J'ai analysé l'un des drones que tu as trouvés dans l'île, et je sais pourquoi il paraît si familier : il m'appartient.",
        "108799766553817162": "Je l'ai déjà vu quelque part avant... dans mes rêves, en tout cas.",
        "108799766553817163": "Après avoir regardé les images que j'ai enregistrées, je savais qu'il était familier. J'ai donc commencé à feuilleter mes anciens carnets de slimologie. Ils contiennent majoritairement des futurs projets, mais également des formes de technologie hypothétiques.",
        "108799766553817164": "Tu me connais, j'ai toujours six coups d'avance. Il le faut, pour maintenir Mochi Tech au top de l'industrie. Et parfois, j'invente l'impossible, des choses que je ne pourrai peut-être jamais créer de mon vivant.",
        "108799766553817165": "Eh bien, ces drones que tu trouves en font partie : ils ne peuvent être réalisés avec les moyens actuels, et viennent directement des pages de mes carnets. Je les ai vus dans mes rêves, Bea !",
        "108799766553817166": "Alors comment des drones impossibles que j'ai concoctés dans un rêve se sont-ils envolés de mes carnets pour atterrir sur l'Île Arc-en-Ciel ?",
        "108799766553817167": "...",
        "108799766553817168": "Peut-être que... qu'il existe une sorte d'archive à l'intérieur que l'on peut débloquer pour en savoir plus. Je sais qu'ils contiennent un registre de données mais si c'était moi... Disons que je suis très forte pour cacher les infos quand je le veux.",
        "108799766553817169": "Bon, j'ai besoin d'y réfléchir. Je te préviens si je pense à quelque chose. La nuit portera peut-être conseil...",
        "108799766553817170": "Salut Bea. J'aimerais que tu tentes un truc et franchement, si ça marche, je vais flipper. Genre, vraiment.",
        "108799766553817171": "Je vais créer le plan d'une clef : une clef d'archive spéciale pour les drones que tu as trouvés. Si des archives existent à l'intérieur, elle devrait t'aider à y accéder.",
        "108799766553817172": "Je dis \"devrait\" parce qu'en fait, j'en sais rien. Mais si ces drones viennent de mes carnets, eh bien, c'est avec cette clef que j'accèderais à leurs archives si j'avais construit un truc de ce genre.",
        "108799766553817173": "Je sais, ça paraît insensé, mais il faut que tu essaies. Si ça marche et qu'il existe une archive qui te permet, je ne sais comment, de mieux comprendre ce qui se passe sur l'île...",
        "108799766558011392": "...eh bien j'aurais été ravie de t'aider. Je te dois encore une faveur après tout, pas vrai ?",
        "108799766558011393": "Ugh. J'ai pas voulu dire ça ! Fabrique-moi cette stupide clef et ne me dis pas tout de suite si elle marche ou pas.",
        "108799766558011394": "Parce que si ça marche, je saurai pas comment digérer cette info.",
        "108799766558011395": "Allez, à plus et bonne chance.",
        "108799766558011396": "Salut Bea. J'allais jeter un truc, puis je me suis dit : \"C'est pas Bea qui adore les vieux déchets dont j'ai plus besoin ? Je parie qu'elle va adorer ça.\"",
        "108799766558011397": "Tu me remercieras plus tard.",
        "108799766558011398": "Saluuuuut Bea ! Devine qui est la personne la plus chanceuse de la galaxie ?",
        "108799766558011399": "TOI ! Parce que t'as reçu un cadeau de la part de la CÉLÈBRE Mochi Miles !",
        "108799766558011400": "Je te laisse digérer l'info. Tu peux même t'assoir, si ça t'aide.",
        "108799766558011401": "Dis Bea, t'avais pas dit y'a un moment que tu voulais, genre, plus de trucs ?",
        "108799766558011402": "Euuuh... non attends, c'est moi qui ai dit ça.",
        "108799766558011403": "Enfin bref, voilà plus de trucs !",
        "108799766558011404": "Salut Bea, je t'envoie un cadeau parce que... bah j'sais pas trop. Enfin bref. J'espère que ça te plaira.",
        "108799766558011405": "Ou pas... Je m'en fiche.",
        "108799766558011406": "Yo Bea, je t'ai pris un petit quelque chose. J'insiste sur le petit.",
        "108799766558011407": "Parce que je me suis fait un GROS cadeau, perso. Et il est beaucoup mieux.",
        "108799766558011408": "Déso Bea, je suis pas dispo. Je suis très occupée à faire des trucs méga importants.",
        "108799766558011409": "Genre bien plus importants que tes affaires, désolée. Je n'ai pas le temps de prendre de tes nouvelles.",
        "108799766558011410": "Mais c'est bien, pas vrai ?",
        "108799766558011411": "Désolée Bea, j'ai une réunion et je suis en retard au fait tu aimes ma coiffure je plaisante je sais qu'elle est parfaite je dois y aller saluuuuuut !!",
        "108799766558011412": "Oh, tu vas regretter d'avoir croisé un jour le chemin de Mochi Miles, attends un peu que je-",
        "108799766558011413": "Oh, Bea ! Désolée, je pensais que c'était l'autre ligne. Je, euh, règle quelques trucs avec l'un de mes concurrents. Juste un petit bavardage amical.",
        "108799766558011414": "Hola Beatrix ! T'es là ? C'est moi, Ogden Ortiz !",
        "108799766558011415": "Il paraît que t'es partie vivre une nouvelle aventure sur une île mystérieuse remplie de secrets et de dangers, et peut-être de fruits et légumes succulents que le monde n'a jamais vus auparavant... ?",
        "108799766558011416": "Il fallait que je demande, tu me connais ! Depuis que tu m'as donné un stock de kookadobas, je cherche à atteindre de nouveaux sommets culinaires sur Far, Far Ouest !",
        "108799766558011417": "... En plus, je commence à fatiguer un poil des tartes au kookadoba, du soufflé au kookadoba, du pudding au kookadoba, du kookadoba con carne, du kookadoba con... kookadoba. ",
        "108799766558011418": "Je n'ai plus d'idées... ni de volonté.",
        "108799766558011419": "Donc, si tu trouves un truc nouveau, tiens-moi au courant. En dehors de ces délicieux mets, la faune et la flore que tu découvriras m'intéressent aussi beaucoup.",
        "108799766558011420": "N'oublie jamais : chaque parcelle de ce monde sauvage est précieuse, et mérite qu'on en prenne soin.",
        "108799766558011421": "Et n'oublie pas de t'hydrater ! Toute cette aventure va te faire transpirer, alors prends ce distributeur d'eau.",
        "108799766558011422": "Bonne chance, Beatrix ! Tiens-moi au courant, je suis à fond avec toi !",
        "108799766558011423": "Beatrix ! Je suis content que tu appelles.",
        "108799766558011424": "J'ai examiné les photos de l'Île Arc-en-Ciel que tu m'as envoyées. Sacrée vue ! Magnifique, avec des couleurs qui deviennent plus profondes chaque fois qu'on les regarde...",
        "108799766558011425": "... mais elles sont presque artificielles. Désolé, mais quelque chose me dérange dans cet endroit.",
        "108799766558011426": "Tu t'en souviens peut-être, j'étais autrefois à la tête d'une société culinaire prospère. L'altération génétique de la nourriture était notre spécialité.",
        "108799766558011427": "Je ne suis pas fier de ce qu'on a fait pour obtenir des aliments plus grands, plus rapidement et à moindre coût : on a retiré le naturel et le meilleur au nom du profit.",
        "108799766558011428": "Si je te dis ça, Beatrix, c'est parce que je sais repérer une plante qui a été altérée. Et les magnifiques arcs-en-ciel que tu vois sur cette île ne sont pas arrivés ici naturellement.",
        "108799766558011429": "J'ignore encore si c'est dangereux pour toi, mais tout ça me met très mal à l'aise. J'ai besoin de faire plus de recherches, et je reviens vers toi.",
        "108799766558011430": "Prends soin de toi, amiga.",
        "108799766558011431": "BAIIIIILLLLEE",
        "108799766558011432": "Oh, lo siento Beatrix ! En ce moment, je passe des nuits entières à lire.",
        "108799766558011433": "J'ai parcouru tous les guides pratiques et les revues botaniques que j'ai pu trouver dans Far, Far Ouest.",
        "108799766558011434": "Je me disais que même si la flore de l'Île Arc-en-Ciel est artificielle, il existe peut-être des informations à son sujet quelque part qui pourraient nous être utiles.",
        "108799766558011435": "Mais il n'y a rien. Je n'ai pas trouvé une seule mention de flore aux teintes multicolores dedans. J'ignore donc ce qui a transformé cette île, mais en tout cas, c'est arrivé récemment.",
        "108799766558011436": "Mais je ne t'apprends rien, je pense, tu as dû le comprendre seule. Entre les choses que tu as décrites, et le fait qu'une portion entière de l'île est divisée en deux couleurs différentes pile au milieu... ?",
        "108799766558011437": "...tout ça sent l'accident, Beatrix.",
        "108799766558011438": "Alors fais bien attention, là dehors. La nature peut être dangereuse, pour nous. Mais ce n'est rien à côté de ce qu'on peut lui faire.",
        "108799766558011439": "Je vais continuer à creuser dans ma bibliothèque, et voir si je peux trouver autre chose pour t'aider. Et si je n'y arrive pas, je te ferai peut-être juste des muffins !",
        "108799766558011440": "Quoi qu'il en soit, te tengo, Beatrix. Adiós!",
        "108799766558011441": "Hola Beatrix ! Je suis content de te voir. J'espère que tu fais attention à toi, et que tu prends le temps de te remplir la panse avant chaque descente dans l'inconnu ?",
        "108799766558011442": "J'ai aussi cru comprendre que l'intrigue se corsait, telle une bonne sauce épicée, et que tu as trouvé une sorte de structure monolithique là-dehors, à l'extrémité de l'île ?",
        "108799766558011443": "Effrayant, tout ça ! Mais ça confirme peut-être mon intuition : l'étrange flore de l'île n'est pas naturelle...",
        "108799766558011444": "Quelque chose cloche, Beatrix. Aucune des ruines découvertes dans Far, Far Ouest n'avait l'air de nuire à son environnement.",
        "108799766558011445": "Certes, on ne connaît ni leur but ni leurs créateurs, mais j'ai toujours eu le sentiment qu'elles respectaient le monde autour d'elles.",
        "108799766558011446": "Mais c'est peut-être arrivé quand même. Parfois, en randonnée, on essaie d'éviter une fleur et on se retrouve à en écraser une autre sans le faire exprès.",
        "108799766558011447": "Parfois, ces fleurs ne peuvent pousser que si on ne les approche jamais.",
        "108799766558011448": "Mais tout n'est pas si terrible : l'Île Arc-en-Ciel semble prospérer quand même, pour l'instant. La nature peut trouver un équilibre, mais ce n'est jamais une garantie.",
        "108799766558011449": "Rah, je suis en train de jouer les moralisateurs. Lo siento, Béatrix. Je ne te retiens pas plus.",
        "108799766558011450": "J'ignore ce que tu trouveras derrière ces murs, mais j'ai foi en toi quelle que soit la situation. Je sais que tu feras ce qu'il faut.",
        "108799766558011451": "Bonne chance, Béatrix.",
        "108799766558011452": "Salut amiga ! J'ai un petit cadeau pour toi. Ce n'est pas fait maison, et ce n'est pas une tarte, et ce n'est pas une tarte faite maison...",
        "108799766558011453": "...mais je me suis dit que ça te plairait quand même. Dommage pour la tarte, cela dit...",
        "108799766558011454": "Hola, Bea ! Je t'ai acheté quelque chose qui pourrait t'être utile.",
        "108799766558011455": "Mais si tu l'as déjà, ce n'est pas remboursé donc... Plus on en a, plus on rit ?",
        "108799766558011456": "Salut Bea, j'ai pris un truc rien que pour toi ! Au départ, ça me paraissait bien...",
        "108799766558011457": "Mais là, j'ai un doute. Euh, si c'est nul, ne me le dis pas, ça me ferait trop mal !",
        "108799766558011458": "Bea, s'il y a bien une chose que je sais sur la vie d'exploratrice solitaire que tu mènes, c'est qu'on a toujours besoin de se rappeler que nos amis pensent à nous.",
        "108799766558011459": "Alors, je suis là pour te le rappeler... via un cadeau. J'espère qu'il te fera penser à moi, et à aux bons moments passés ensemble. Ciao, Bea !",
        "108799766558011460": "Salut amiga, comment tu vas ? Quand je me sens seul, je fais un truc sympa pour mes amis. Ça me met du baume au cœur à tous les coups !",
        "108799766558011461": "C'est ma façon de te dire que je pense à toi.",
        "108799766558011462": "Désolé Bea, je ne peux pas parler ! Toutes mes poules se sont envolées de leur poulailler ! Je suis dans un chaos de plumes. Si je n'ai pas répondu demain, c'est qu'elles ont gagné la guerre.",
        "108799766558011463": "Lo siento, Bea. Je vais sortir un énorme soufflé du four et ça exige la plus grande des concentrations.",
        "108799766558011464": "Après ça, je vais manger un énorme soufflé et ça demande la plus grande des concentrations.",
        "108799766558011465": "Salut amiga, je suis pas dispo j'ai beaucoup de choses à faire. Notamment une salade avec un oignon étrange qui est mûr à point.",
        "108799766558011466": "J'ai dû manger plein de carottes pour l'obtenir, hors de question que je loupe ça.",
        "108799766558011467": "Mais dis donc, v'là notre Beatrix Lebeau ! Le vieux Hob' et moi on parlait de toi, justement. Y paraît que t'es partie explorer des coins inconnus de ce gros caillou pour étancher ta soif d'aventures ?",
        "108799766558011468": "C'est bien, ma fille ! Continue donc de chercher des merveilles jusqu'à c'que tes bottes n'soient plus qu'un tas de trous. Pis après, tu te rachètes des bottes et tu repars pour un tour !",
        "108799766558011469": "Moi, enfin mes bottes ont connu des jours meilleurs, mais je sais qu'il leur reste encore une aventure ou deux. J'imagine qu'y reste p'us qu'à trouver lesquelles...",
        "108799766558011470": "M'enfin, je radote comme Hobson quand il parle d'explorer le cosmos, de cuisiner ou de n'importe quel autre sujet.",
        "108799766558011471": "Tiens bon, Bea. Je t'appellerai pour prendre de tes nouvelles. Peu importe qui t'es, on a tous le mal du pays à un moment ou à un autre.",
        "108799766558011472": "Ah, et avant que j'oublie, voilà un p'tit que'que chose pour redonner un coup d'jeune a ta nouvelle demeure. C'est pas grand-chose, mais tout est bon pour en faire un nid douillet.",
        "108799766558011473": "Coucou Bea ! Tu passes du bon temps sur l'Île Arc-en-Ciel ? Ha, rien que l'nom est amusant. Tu dois t'éclater !",
        "108799766558011474": "Tu sais, depuis que je sais que t'es partie vers de nouveaux horizons, je réfléchis à ma propre vie et à ce que je pourrais faire de \"nouveau\".",
        "108799766558011475": "Hobson et moi on en a tellement fait dans nos vies, on a enchaîné les aventures tout autour de ce gros caillou. Et depuis qu'on s'est rencontrés, on n'a pas arrêté.",
        "108799766558011476": "Donc on cherche une nouvelle aventure à faire ensemble, mais on n'sait ni quand, ni où.",
        "108799766558011477": "On pourrait p'têtre explorer des coins reculés de Far, Far Ouest comme toi, ou même viser les étoiles comme Hobson avant.",
        "108799766558011478": "Quoi qu'on décide, ce sera génial parce qu'on partagera cette expérience ensemble. C'est ça qui m'botte le plus !",
        "108799766558011479": "C'est difficile de trouver quelqu'un qui nous convient parfaitement, tell'ment rare. Comme trouver deux flocons de neige identiques dans le désert.",
        "108799766558011480": "... Je sais que ça résonne totalement en toi.",
        "108799766558011481": "J'oublie jamais à quel point j'suis chanceuse, Bea. Je veux utiliser les dons que l'univers a bien voulu m'donner.",
        "108799766558011482": "...",
        "108799766558011483": "Hauts les cœurs, ma fille. On se reparle bientôt.",
        "108799766558011484": "Oh, Bea. J'suis contente de t'avoir. J'ai une grande nouvelle à annoncer et y'a pas grand-monde sur ce caillou à qui je peux parler.",
        "108799766558011485": "Hobson et moi on a beaucoup pensé à not' prochaine aventure. On a lu nos carnets de voyage pour tenter de trouver un endroit où aucun d'nous deux n'a été.",
        "108799766558011486": "On en a trouvé, mais aucun d'entre eux ne nous inspirait. On s'est dit qu'il était p't'être temps pour nous de nous poser ?",
        "108799766558011487": "Puis, on a bavardé et on a réalisé que notre activité préférée du moment, c'était d'être à deux dans mon ranch.",
        "108799766558011488": "Ce ranch était l'un des premiers sur Far, Far Ouest et on a tant appris tous les deux... alors on a commencé à parler de le léguer à quelqu'un...",
        "108799766558011489": "... Du coup, Hobson et moi on a décidé de fonder une famille, Bea. Et pour la première fois depuis très longtemps... j'ai peur !",
        "108799766558011490": "Hobson et moi on est tellement indépendants, on n'sait rien de rien sur le fait d'être parents, et on sait fichtrement pas comment élever un gamin sur Far, Far Ouest.",
        "108799766558011491": "Mais j'aime ce vieux grincheux et l'idée d'avoir un mini nous qui me regarde avec ses yeux, ça m'fait sourire...",
        "108799766558011492": "Rien que cette pensée me donne envie de déplacer des montagnes pour y arriver.",
        "108799766558011493": "Donc j'ai pas mal de boulot. Il y a tellement de trucs à mettre en ordre !",
        "108799766558011494": "Merci de m'avoir écoutée, Bea. Parfois, quand on partage ses craintes avec quelqu'un, on se sent moins seule.",
        "108799766558011495": "Prends soin de toi, Bea.",
        "108799766558011496": "Salut Bea, comment se passe l'exploration ? Il paraît que t'es à fond dans les mystères de l'île !\r\nÇa a l'air passionnant !",
        "108799766558011497": "Perso, je me demande pourquoi tout ce qui touche aux bébés est si compliqué ! J'ai escaladé des montagnes qui étaient moins complexes que ces berceaux à monter avec la toute petite clé qu'on nous refourgue.",
        "108799766558011498": "Enfin bref, Hobson et moi on voulait te remercier. Sans toi, je crois pas qu'on aurait réalisé qu'on avait envie d'un p'tit bout dans notre vie.",
        "108799766558011499": "Je me suis toujours retrouvée un peu en toi, et quand tu as restauré la vieille ferme d'Hobson, ça nous a permis de comprendre que laisser une marque, c'est bien, mais c'est chouette aussi de voir la jeunesse en faire que'que chose de nouveau.",
        "108799766558011500": "On a hâte de voir ce que not' petit bout va faire avec ce ranch, ou les aventures qui l'attendent.",
        "108799766558011501": "Alors merci, Bea. T'enrichis vraiment not' vie, à Hobson et moi. Je te souhaite le meilleur.",
        "108799766558011502": "Mais un dernier truc...",
        "108799766558011503": "Hobson voulait savoir pourquoi tu as décidé de ne pas utiliser l'ancienne machine dans les ruines du désert de verre pour partir à l'aventure dans le cosmos ?",
        "108799766558011504": "Je lui ai dit, Hobson Twillgers, quand une femme décide de traverser l'espace et le temps, ses choix lui appartiennent, mais il est trop curieux.",
        "108799766558011505": "... Hein ?",
        "108799766558011506": "C'était cassé ? C'est bizarre... Hobson dit que ce truc était en parfait état quand il est parti. Que la porte était ouverte, prête à accueillir les prochains aventuriers.",
        "108799766558011507": "Eh ben, Beatrix Lebeau... On dirait bien que t'as trouvé un nouveau mystère.",
        "108799766558011508": "Bonne chance, Bea ! Quand t'auras terminé, tu pourras peut-être écrire un bouquin dessus. Ça f'rait une super histoire !",
        "108799766562205696": "Salut Bea, je voulais te donner un p'tit quelque chose alors j'ai tenté de faire des biscuits mais euh, j'suis pas la meilleure des pâtissières...",
        "108799766562205697": "Hobson a dit qu'ils étaient vraiment, vraimeeeeent... comestibles.",
        "108799766562205698": "... Bref, je t'ai acheté un truc à la place. J'espère que ça te plaira !",
        "108799766562205699": "Tu sais Bea, on dit que les meilleurs cadeaux viennent du cœur.",
        "108799766562205700": "Celui-ci vient d'un magasin... mais c'est presque pareil, non ?",
        "108799766562205701": "Salut Bea, je sais, c'est idiot mais je m'inquiète pour toi, tu bosses dur là-dehors...",
        "108799766562205702": "Alors je t'ai envoyé un petit colis avec plein de bonnes choses. J'espère que ça te requinquera !",
        "108799766562205703": "Ha ha ha, t'en fait pas, je lui dirais. Chut maintenant, je lui parle.",
        "108799766562205704": "Bea, Hobson veut te donner ça... il dit que si t'en veux pas, ça pourra toujours servir pour faire du feu.",
        "108799766562205705": "J'suis toujours ravie d'avoir de tes nouvelles, ma grande. Mais je dois aller chercher Hobson - le tracteur est encore tombé en panne en plein milieu du champ. Je lui dirai bonjour de ta part !",
        "108799766562205706": "Bea, je peux pas parler là. Une tempête arrive ici, et mon café est presque prêt. Les deux exigent toute mon attention. J'dois y aller !",
        "108799766562205707": "Désolée Bea, je dois libérer cette ligne pour Hobson. Il papote avec un copain à lui à propos de j'sais pas quoi toute la journée. Un type étrange dans un manteau, j'y comprends rien du tout.",

        "434160855006474240": "Ce sont de vraies anguilles, hein ? Les slimes d'ombre se carapatent dès qu'ils te voient ou en cas de perturbations prismatiques. Tu as donc intérêt à en chercher dans les endroits qui n'ont pas subi de perturbations récemment.",
        "434160855480430592": "Quand tu repères un groupe, approche-toi discrètement et essaie d'assommer un maximum de plortes avant qu'ils s'enfuient. Je te conseille de prévoir quelques déchets en plus dans ton aspipack pour ça.",

        "434169723770007552": "Enfin, peu importe. Le détecteur de perturbations est très simple à utiliser. Il te suffit d'en fabriquer un et de le placer quelque part dans le Dédale pour qu'il détecte les perturbations prismatiques.",
        "434169724218798080": "Une fois posé, le détecteur te préviendra quand une perturbation prismatique est sur le point de se produire ou est en cours dans cette zone.",
        "434169724671782912": "Tu peux obtenir des plortes prismatiques dans les perturbations prismatiques qui sèment la zizanie dans tout le Dédale. Les zones touchées se mettent à rayonner d'énergie prismatique, qui s'intensifie au fil du temps.",
        "434169725158322176": "Pendant ces perturbations, tu trouveras par terre des aliments rendus instables par les effets du Prismacœur. Donne-les à manger aux slimes pour qu'ils produisent des plortes instables.",
        "434169725653250048": "Des plortes instables ? Comment je fais pour les stabiliser ?",
        "434169726093651968": "Tu peux stabiliser les plortes instables pour les transformer en plortes prismatiques à l'aide des stabilisateurs qui se trouvent dans le Dédale. D'après mes recherches, il en existe deux formes.",
        "434169726567608320": "Tout d'abord, les stabilisateurs anciens, en forme d'anneaux, qui sont cachés un peu partout dans le Dédale. Ils sont gros, alors tu ne risques pas de les rater.",
        "434169727016398848": "Ensuite, il y a les stabilisateurs temporels, des appareils splendides qui se présentent sous la forme de petits anneaux d'énergie dorée pendant les perturbations prismatiques. Ces dernières sont chaotiques, alors reste sur tes gardes.",
        "434169727490355200": "Dans les deux cas, tu trouveras des plortes prismatiques en tirant des plortes instables à travers ces anneaux. Tu peux même sauter à travers les stabilisateurs anciens pour stabiliser tous tes plortes d'un coup. Sympa, non ?",
        "434169727981088768": "Bonne exploration !",
        "434189984019935232": "Aucun secret ne t'échappe, à toi ! J'ai mis une éternité à trouver cet endroit.",
        "434189987203411968": "J'ai l'impression qu'il y a des secrets à tous les coins de rue ici.",

        "434189988549783552": "On dirait bien, oui. Je pense que si le Dédale est aussi étrange, c'est parce qu'il a été élargi au fil du temps. Et au bout d'un moment, il a fallu faire preuve d'originalité pour l'agrandir au-delà de ses limites.",
        "434189989002768384": "D'originalité ?",
        "434189989472530432": "Comme tu le sais, le Dédale semble plus grand vu de l'intérieur que de l'extérieur. Je crois que c'est la conséquence d'une technologie issue du Prismacœur lui-même.",
        "434189989963264000": "Ça va te paraître dingue, mais dans sa forme la plus concentrée, l'énergie du Prismacœur semble capable de modifier la réalité.",
        "434189990416248832": "À mon avis, les bâtisseurs ont fini par agrandir le Dédale pour tenter de contenir toute l'énergie du Prismacœur. Puis, comme ça ne marchait pas, ils ont eu recours à une technologie capable de modifier la réalité pour l'agrandir encore plus.",
        "434189990873427968": "Mais à un moment donné, il y a eu un problème. Et maintenant, l'énergie du Prismacœur se propage sur toute l'Île Arc-en-Ciel.",
        "434189991326412800": "Je suis désolée, mais je ne savais pas si je pouvais faire confiance à Viktor, et je devais m'assurer qu'il pouvait bel et bien m'aider. Pour toi, les portes du Dédale étaient fermées, mais pas pour moi. En tout cas, elles ne l'étaient plus.",
        "434189991829729280": "J'ai été confrontée pour la première fois au Prismacœur avant d'arriver ici, quand la catastrophe s'est produite... et je n'en suis pas ressortie indemne. J'ai bien essayé de me protéger de l'explosion, et j'ai survécu, mais quelque chose avait changé.",
        "434189992282714112": "Mon corps est imprégné d'une partie de l'énergie caractéristique du Prismacœur. C'est pour ça que je ne peux pas trop m'en approcher et que j'ai besoin de ton aide.",
        "434189992735698944": "Je ne pouvais pas laisser tout ça se reproduire, tu comprends. Si j'avais laissé quelqu'un de mal intentionné entrer ici... En tout cas, c'est notre dernière chance, tu peux me croire.",
        "434189993218043904": "Il n'y aura pas de retour en arrière pour moi.",
        "434189993696194560": "Si quelqu'un peut trouver une solution, c'est bien toi, Beatrix.",
        "434192420939919360": "J'ai surnommé cet endroit le Pays des rêves. À une époque, je venais ici pour me réfugier parmi les nuages. C'est l'endroit idéal pour oublier ses soucis.",
        "434192423401975808": "C'est ici que le Dédale génère son atmosphère ?",
        "434192423859154944": "Est-ce que tu as des rêves, Gigi ?",
        "434192424307945472": "Je pense qu'il est temps pour moi d'explorer ce Pays des rêves à mon tour.",
        "434192424760930304": "Je pense que oui, et peut-être même autre chose. Ici, l'air est différent. C'est difficile à expliquer, mais on a presque l'impression que les nuages et même les îles sur lesquelles tu marches sont constitués de matière céleste.",
        "434192425192943616": "À croire qu'ils n'ont pas été construits, mais assemblés à partir de petits bouts de néant. J'ai passé beaucoup de temps sur ces îles et parfois, j'aurais juré sentir une espèce de courant. Comme si je devenais capable de les contrôler.",
        "434192425650122752": "Un jour, j'avais le mal du pays et je suis venue ici pour repenser à mon enfance, à l'époque où j'étais dans le jardin et où je sentais l'odeur du dîner que ma mère était en train de préparer dans la maison.",
        "434192426132467712": "J'adorais admirer le potager tout en humant le parfum des légumes poêlés qui provenait de la cuisine. J'avais l'impression que tout était lié.",
        "434192426606424064": "Et donc, alors que j'étais assise ici, j'ai fermé les paupières pour essayer de visualiser ce jardin, et à ce moment-là, je te jure que j'ai senti l'odeur de la cuisine de ma mère.",
        "434192427101351936": "Quand j'ai rouvert les yeux, j'ai aperçu une nouvelle île devant moi, au loin, et dessus, il y avait la maison où j'avais grandi. Mais un instant plus tard, elle a disparu dans les nuages...",
        "434192427579502592": "J'avais plein de rêves, avant. Je voulais me libérer des attentes de mes parents. Je voulais vivre comme je l'entendais. Alors j'ai rêvé de m'enfuir et de faire ce que je voulais de ma vie.",
        "434192428028293120": "Je rêvais qu'un jour, ils découvriraient la personne que je serais devenue et qu'ils seraient contents pour moi. Et que tout irait bien dans le meilleur des mondes. Qu'ils ne m'en voudraient pas de les avoir abandonnés.",
        "434192428472889344": "Mais quand on est jeune, on ne se rend pas toujours compte à quel point ce qu'on a sous les yeux est brisé. On voit le monde comme un miroir de salle de bains couvert de buée : on distingue les formes, mais pas les détails.",
        "434192428925874176": "Aujourd'hui, je sais que ma mère ne s'est jamais remise du décès de ma grand-mère. Je n'avais pas réalisé qu'elle se sentait obligée de poursuivre son œuvre ni à quel point elle était triste... Je n'ai compris tout ça que longtemps après mon départ.",
        "434192429374664704": "Aujourd'hui, je rêve de rentrer un jour chez moi chez moi et de retrouver mes parents, qui comprendraient pourquoi je suis partie. Au final, c'est ce qu'on veut tous, je pense... Être compris par ses parents.",
        "434192429836038144": "Sois prudente. Les rêves peuvent disparaître à tout moment.",
        "434196761864204288": "Salut, Beatrix. Tu ne t'es pas encore perdue dans ce Pays des rêves, on dirait.",
        "434196764397563904": "J'ai l'impression que tout se transforme en or par ici...",
        "434196764867325952": "Ça t'arrive de te sentir perdue, Gigi ?",
        "434196765337088000": "Oui, c'est parce que le Pays des rêves est très proche du Prismacœur. On en voit les effets les plus néfastes.",
        "434196765790072832": "Ici, j'ai déjà vu l'eau se changer en verre, les arbres en métal, et des structures entières entourant le Prismacœur devenir presque invisibles avant de disparaître complètement, comme un nuage balayé par le vent.",
        "434196766251446272": "Petit à petit, tout le Pays des rêves se changera en or si on ne fait rien. L'endroit où tu te trouves finira par devenir trop lourd et tomber du ciel. À terme, l'atmosphère générée ici s'effondrera, ce qui déstabilisera encore davantage le Dédale.",
        "434196766717014016": "Et quand celui-ci tombera à son tour et l'énergie du Prismacœur se propagera sur tout Far, Far Ouest, cette planète deviendra méconnaissable et il n'y aura plus rien de vivant à sa surface.",
        "434196767195164672": "Les slimes...",
        "434196767660732416": "Oui, même nos coriaces petits slimes ne survivraient pas à une catastrophe pareille. Mais ça n'arrivera pas. Toi et moi, on va trouver une solution.",
        "434196768130494464": "Je me sens perdue tout le temps. Mais jamais autant que la fois où j'ai traversé le désert de verre.",
        "434196768587673600": "Tu as traversé le désert de verre ?",
        "434196769053241344": "Oui, deux fois même, c'est pour te dire ! Et pour être franche, j'ai bien failli y rester...",
        "434196769531392000": "En fait, quand j'ai commencé à étudier le désert de verre, j'ai trouvé que son nom ne lui allait pas du tout. Je n'ai vu qu'une étendue verdoyante regorgeant de vie.",
        "434196769996959744": "C'est dû à une eau très particulière qu'on trouve là-bas, et qui est capable de faire pousser comme par magie des... Mais à quoi bon te raconter ça, tu es déjà au courant.",
        "434196770475110400": "Du coup, je ne me suis pas assez bien préparée. Et pendant le voyage du retour... j'ai compris que le désert de verre portait bien son nom.",
        "434196770932289536": "Ce n'était plus qu'une terre inculte et aride. Les bourrasques me cinglaient les joues et m'aveuglaient. Et à chaque fois que je croyais réussir à me situer, des flammes se mettaient à jaillir tout autour de moi.",
        "434196771376885760": "Comment tu as eu le courage de continuer ?",
        "434196771855036416": "Gigi ne répond pas tout de suite et effleure du bout des doigts les lambeaux de sa cape.",
        "434196772320604160": "Cette carte appartenait à ma grand-mère. Enfin, c'était la couverture qu'elle mettait sur ses jambes à partir d'un certain âge. Si on en croit les photos en tout cas. Ma mère en a hérité, puis elle me l'a donnée.",
        "434196772781977600": "Dès que je l'abîmais, elle la raccommodait tout de suite. Elle faisait de son mieux, mais à force, il y avait plein de coutures disparates.",
        "434196773243351040": "Un jour, j'étais assise dans une grotte et j'écoutais la tempête qui faisait rage dehors. J'étais emmitouflée dans la cape et je pleurais à chaudes larmes. J'étais exténuée et je n'en pouvais plus.",
        "434196773717307392": "À ce moment-là, j'ai senti ma mère me protéger. J'ai regardé toutes les coutures sur le tissu qui m'entourait et j'ai réalisé qu'elle n'avait jamais baissé les bras, qu'elle avait persévéré envers et contre tout.",
        "434196774170292224": "Et même si le tissu était tout rapiécé et ne serait plus jamais comme avant, il était toujours là. Il m'a sauvé, comme on va sauver cet endroit. Il ne sera peut-être jamais comme avant, mais on ne baissera pas les bras, Beatrix.",
        "434196774627471360": "Courage, Beatrix.",
        "434198584142491648": "Je n'arrive pas à croire que tu sois arrivée aussi loin, Beatrix. Ce labyrinthe n'aurait fait qu'une bouchée d'une personne ordinaire. Mais toi, tu es différente. J'ai bien fait de croire en toi.",
        "434198586608742400": "Le Prismacœur est droit devant. Peut-être qu'ensemble, on a une chance de neutraliser cette chose et de changer l'avenir de Far, Far Ouest.",

        "428361726045089795": "Nos échanges n'ont laissé aucun doute, mais étonnamment, ils m'ont aussi fourni de la chaleur et de l'accompagnement dans les jours sombres que je traverse actuellement.",
        "428361726045089796": "Je t'envoie le plan partiel d'un gadget que j'ai essayé de développer sans succès. Si tu arrives à le terminer, je pense que c'est la clé pour entrer dans le Dédale Gris. ",
        "428361726045089797": "Sache, Viktor, que je n'ai jamais voulu te tromper. Mais je dois savoir à qui je peux faire confiance pour avoir une chance de réparer les choses. Si cela arrive, j'aimerais te rencontrer un jour.",

        "428361726045089802": "Voici donc le plan final, d'après ses instructions. On dirait que c'est un appareil dont tu auras besoin près des entrées du Dédale. Je n'en sais pas plus.",

        "494426433331556352": "Je l'espère vraiment. À mon avis, tout ce qui est instable ou déplacé ici est le résultat des vagues prismatiques qui parcourent le Dédale et causent des transmutations. Si je pouvais inventer une machine pour annuler leurs effets dans une zone précise, tu pourrais découvrir où sont cachés les harmoniseurs.\n",
        "494426435990745088": "Comment comptes-tu faire pour construire un truc pareil ?",
        "494426436984795136": "Eh bien, pour commencer, j'aurais besoin de plortes prismatiques pour concevoir le plan. Il faudra effectuer toute une batterie de tests pour déterminer les paramètres avec lesquels travailler.",
        "503065643299008514": "Pour ce qui est de la construction... ces étranges slimes d'ombre pourraient être la réponse. Leurs plortes ont un effet naturel qui tend à amoindrir des vagues prismatiques. C'est peut-être le résultat de leur évolution... Ils peuvent diminuer la fréquence de ces vagues afin de...",
        "503065643299008515": "Excuse-moi, j'ai pas mal de pain sur la planche, là. Garde un œil sur les plortes d'ombre, elles pourraient être utiles plus tard. En attendant, apporte-moi tes plortes prismatiques pour que je puisse avancer sur le suppresseur de vagues.",
        "494426436498255872": "Compris.",
        "503065643299008518": "On est tout près du but, Beatrix. Jetons un œil à ça...",
        "512531865044414464": "Je compte sur toi pour obtenir ces plortes afin que je puisse concevoir le plan du suppresseur. C'est peut-être peine perdue, mais il faut garder espoir, Beatrix.",
        "512855595578716160": "Maintenant que tu as le plan du suppresseur, va le fabriquer au Forgeur dans la serre. Tu pourras ensuite commencer à chercher les zones cachées derrière les murs étranges.",
        "512528636512464896": "Continue de chercher des murs étranges. En utilisant le suppresseur, il devrait être possible de les franchir. Avec un peu de chance, tu y trouveras les harmoniseurs, ce qui nous permettra de stabiliser le Prismacœur.",
        "515408179648688128": "Ceci est un message enregistré : tu as activé tous les harmoniseurs ! Viens me retrouver près du Prismacœur. C'est là que les choses sérieuses commencent...",

        "459162059549601792": "Salut, Beatrix. On dirait bien qu'il reste des harmoniseurs à activer.\r",
        "512135795118338048": "Utilise le suppresseur pour ouvrir des chemins cachés dans le Dédale. Cherche les murs qui ont un aspect étrange, comme s'ils avaient été modifiés par des vagues prismatiques.",
        "512137435087007744": "Impressionnant ! Tu as activé tous les harmoniseurs. On va pouvoir commencer le processus de stabilisation du Prismacœur.",
        "512137648556109824": "Pour ce faire, nous allons avoir besoin de beaucoup d'eau, mais tu n'as pas l'air d'avoir de réservoir d'eau. Essaie d'en fabriquer un au Forgeur de la serre, puis reviens me dire quand ce sera bon.",
        "508172740122537984": "J'ai installé cette douche hydraulique au cas où il y aurait une urgence. Cela dit, il n'y a pas d'eau qui coule ici, juste un tas de tuyaux. Si on arrive à acheminer de l'eau, cette douche s'avérera utile... tu peux me croire.",
        "508173982047563776": "Je rentrerai dans les détails plus tard.\r",
        "459162940231806976": "Je vais m'en occuper.",
        "459163070364282880": "J'ai besoin de me préparer.",
        "459163407372414976": "Reviens quand tu voudras, je ne bouge pas.",
        "459163883820183552": "Encore une fois, je compte sur toi, Beatrix.\r",
        "512137991872475136": "Ça y est, Beatrix. Avec les harmoniseurs activés, et grâce à ton aide, je peux tenter de stabiliser le Prismacœur.",
        "512152448220688384": "Beatrix ! Les relevés du Prismacœur... Ils sont stables ! Il évolue sur une fréquence complètement différente à présent ! Je... Je peux le sentir.",
        "512404458169856000": "Le voilà, Beatrix... Le Prismacœur.\r",
        "512404595482980352": "Je suis restée interdite lorsque je l'ai vu pour la première fois. La façon dont la lumière se diffusait à l'intérieur, et le fait qu'elle semblait se transformer à chaque instant... C'était comme regarder l'infini. Si seulement j'avais su ce qu'il adviendrait d'elle, de moi... de tout.",
        "512405717933256704": "Pardonne-moi de t'avoir entraînée dans tout ça, mais c'était le seul moyen.\r",
        "512520617573642240": "Comme je le disais, je pense pouvoir inventer un appareil qui permet de découvrir des zones cachées dans le Dédale.",
        "512775262921453568": "Cela prendra du temps pour que l'île revienne à son état naturel et que les effets comme les perturbations prismatiques ne s'estompent. L'Île Arc-en-Ciel... que dis-je... l'avenir de tout Far, Far Ouest est sauf. Tu as réussi, Beatrix. Je ne sais pas comment te remercier.",
        "522633243620175872": "Dieu merci, tu es de retour. J'ai pu arrêter le processus et nettoyer la salle juste à temps. Quel soulagement d'avoir installé cette douche d'urgence !",
        "523379801986854912": "Salut, Beatrix. J'appelle cette zone le Terrarium.",
        "523379806806110208": "Pourquoi ce nom ?",
        "523379807615610880": "À quoi sert cet endroit ? À la préservation ?",
        "523379808395751424": "Je vais aller voir ça tout de suite.",
        "523379809226223616": "Eh bien... un terrarium n'est qu'un conteneur dans lequel on conserve des plantes en dehors de leur environnement d'origine.",
        "523379810023141376": "Lors de mon premier passage ici, j'y ai simplement vu une magnifique biosphère avec une nourriture unique et des slimes.",
        "523379810853613568": "Et... c'est peut-être le cas, tout compte fait. Il est possible que ce ne soit qu'une façon de représenter le monde extérieur ici, dans le Dédale, bien à l'abri derrière une vitre.",
        "523379811671502848": "Mais... je commence à douter.",
        "523379812455837696": "Qu'est-ce que tu en penses ?",
        "523379813261144064": "Je devrais peut-être y aller.",
        "523379814079033344": "C'est ça le problème, Beatrix. Je n'ai aucun moyen de savoir vraiment. Mais...",
        "523379814884339712": "Je pense vraiment que le Dédale dans son ensemble est une installation destinée à contenir et à stabiliser le Prismacœur. Le Terrarium a donc un rapport avec ça.",
        "523379815681257472": "Et en réfléchissant bien...",
        "523379816478175232": "Je me demande s'il ne s'agit pas d'une sorte de banque de semences. Si les choses tournaient vraiment mal dans le futur, si le Prismacœur devenait trop instable et se brisait... ce serait un moyen de s'assurer la survie d'une partie de la flore au cataclysme qui s'ensuivrait.",
        "523379817296064512": "Si c'est le cas, cela signifierait que le Terrarium est en fait un genre de police d'assurance, de sorte que si le pire se produit, on peut tout recommencer.",
        "523379818080399360": "Enfin, je veux dire, on peut l'imaginer.",
        "523379818885705728": "Que veux-tu dire ?",
        "523379819695206400": "Je ferai en sorte d'arrêter ça avant que les choses en arrivent là.",
        "523379820555038720": "Eh bien...",
        "523379821393899520": "...",
        "523379822186622976": "B-Bien sûr, j'ai besoin de croire que mes actions peuvent contribuer à préserver l'avenir. Il est naturel de penser de la sorte, même s'il n'y a aucun moyen de savoir si cela aura un réel impact.",
        "523379823033872384": "Mais...",
        "523379823839178752": "Disons que pour tous ceux qui existent dans le futur, ce qui se passe aujourd'hui est le passé. Nous voulons que les gens du futur regardent ce que nous faisons et réalisent que nos actions ont fait la différence.",
        "523379824648679424": "Ou, mieux encore, nous voulons faire en sorte qu'ils n'aient jamais à s'en inquiéter.",
        "523379825487540224": "Ce que nous faisons ici finira par faire la différence. Je dois y croire.",
        "523379826301235200": "Tout ce que nous pouvons faire, c'est vivre le moment présent.",
        "523379827114930176": "La situation est terrible, mais... il y a beaucoup de choses qui méritent d'être sauvées. J'espère que tu prendras le temps d'en profiter, toi aussi.",
        "523380586816630784": "Salut, Beatrix. C'est un endroit fascinant, n'est-ce pas ?",
        "523380587600965632": "On dirait un musée !",
        "523380588435632128": "Nous n'avons pas de temps à perdre, Gigi.",
        "523380589240938496": "C'est ce que semblent indiquer ces vitrines, mais je crois qu'elles sont là pour autre chose. En fait, je suis convaincue qu'elles ont quelque chose à voir avec la manipulation du temps.",
        "523380590050439168": "J'observe depuis un certain temps celles qui contiennent des plantes et j'ai remarqué que le temps s'écoule plus vite à l'intérieur de celles-ci.",
        "523380590868328448": "Il pourrait s'agir d'un moyen d'analyser les effets du Prismacœur sur les êtres vivants... et de prédire ce qui se passerait si une brèche devait survenir.",
        "523380591715577856": "Cela se produit-il aussi avec les petits bâtiments ?",
        "523380592537661440": "Pas le temps de s'attarder là.",
        "523380593342967808": "Peut-être, mais aucun moyen d'en être sûr.",
        "523380594135691264": "Peut-être est-ce le cas, ou peut-être s'agit-il de manipulation de l'espace... ou même une troisième alternative qui nous est tellement étrangère que nous n'aurons jamais les connaissances nécessaires pour la concevoir.",
        "523380594928414720": "Il y a tellement de mystères sur l'Île Arc-en-Ciel, Beatrix... Je pense que nous n'en résoudrons pas même la moitié au cours de notre existence.",
        "523380595721138176": "Parfois, on ne peut que regarder à travers la vitre et s'interroger sur ce qui se passe de l'autre côté.",
        "523380596513861632": "Ça te le fait souvent ?",
        "523380597340139520": "Ça fait longtemps que j'ai cette sensation, à vrai dire.",
        "523380598174806016": "Tu sais, ma vie était déjà toute tracée : je devais reprendre le ranch une fois adulte, comme ma mère l'a fait après ma grand-mère... pour le transmettre ensuite à un de mes enfants. Et cela avec tout l'amour du monde, bien entendu. Une belle maison, notre héritage familial.",
        "523380598980112384": "Pour moi, le monde était si petit, comme si je me tenais sous l'un de ces dômes, pressant mes mains contre la vitre et imaginant la vie que je mènerais si je n'étais pas née dans un ranch.",
        "523380599785418752": "Je suis venue sur l'Île Arc-en-Ciel pour changer de vie. Mais cette fois-ci, je me retrouve réellement piégée. Ironique, n'est-ce pas ? Enfermée derrière une vitre, comme tout le reste ici.",
        "523380600670416896": "Je viendrai te libérer dès que possible.",
        "523380601471528960": "Je sais que nous devons nous dépêcher, mais prends aussi le temps d'apprécier ce qui se trouve autour de toi.",
        "523382731968245760": "Oh non... il y a de l'or ici. Même le Terrarium commence à être touché. Enfin, c'est probablement un autre raccourci utile.",
        "523382733075542016": "L'or... C'est un problème, hein ?",
        "523382733901819904": "Un raccourci ?",
        "523382734740680704": "Il faut y aller.",
        "523382735625678848": "Tout ce qui se trouve à proximité du Prismacœur peut être affecté par ses propriétés d'altération de la réalité. Les matériaux se transforment, passent de l'état solide à l'état liquide ou gazeux, disparaissent complètement...",
        "523382736426790912": "À l'extérieur du Dédale, il s'agit de changements apparemment inoffensifs, mais ici, c'est plus dangereux. Imagine que la partie du sol sur laquelle tu te trouves disparaisse sous tes pieds, ou que la seule porte de sortie se transforme en une paroi rocheuse...",
        "523382737257263104": "Et l'or... il semble que ce soit la plus puissante des transmutations, et c'est probablement le destin de ce monde si tout devient hors de contrôle.",
        "523382738058375168": "Ça me fait penser à l'histoire du roi Midas.",
        "523382738859487232": "Le roi Midas ?",
        "523382739689959424": "Il s'agit d'un mythe qui raconte l'histoire d'un roi nommé Midas. Il avait fait le vœu de transformer en or tout ce qu'il touchait. Il devint immensément riche, mais découvrit alors qu'il ne pouvait plus manger ni boire, et dépérit.",
        "523382740512043008": "Lorsque j'ai découvert le Prismacœur, j'ai été horrifiée de voir tout l'écosystème se transformer en or. J'ai appelé à l'aide, mais ceux qui sont arrivés n'ont eu d'yeux que pour la valeur de cet or.",
        "523382741329932288": "... Ils ont essayé d'exploiter toute cette puissance, et ça s'est soldé par un désastre. Il ne faut pas que cela se reproduise. Jamais.",
        "523382742143627264": "Je dois donc me dépêcher et utiliser ce raccourci ?",
        "523382742982488064": "C'est vrai, je me souviens qu'il y en avait un. Mais ma mémoire n'est pas très fiable, ces derniers temps.",
        "523382743829737472": "Les raccourcis représentent un phénomène vraiment étrange. L'espace et le temps sont constellés de raccourcis, quand on y pense. J'ai utilisé mes connaissances de la région et la technologie quantique pour installer ces projecteurs. C'est une sorte de raccourci temporel.",
        "523382744668598272": "Les raccourcis physiques sont peut-être plus facilement identifiables. Savoir qu'il existe des moyens rapides de retourner à des endroits où on se trouvait par le passé... ça peut faire toute la différence, n'est-ce pas ? Le pouvoir de changer nos actions... Ça a été le cas pour moi.",
        "523382745478098944": "Mais je suppose que d'une manière ou d'une autre, on finit toujours au même endroit à la fin.",
        "523382746308571136": "À plus tard, Beatrix.",
        "523383596829536256": "Beatrix, regarde par la fenêtre. Il y a tellement plus de choses dehors que je ne l'avais imaginé.",
        "523383597957804032": "Tu y es déjà allée, auparavant ?",
        "523383598784081920": "Pourquoi avoir mis le projecteur ici ?",
        "523383599606165504": "C'est surprenant... mais je ferais mieux de continuer.",
        "523383600424054784": "Non. Je ne me souviens pas avoir vu quoi que ce soit à travers ces fenêtres. C'est bien la première fois... et c'est parce que tu as activé le projecteur.",
        "523383601229361152": "À l'époque, je pensais vraiment avoir parcouru l'ensemble des installations. J'étais sûre d'avoir dressé les plans de toute la zone.",
        "523383602017890304": "Mais à présent, j'entrevois ce qui me semble être une étendue infinie, un labyrinthe à perte de vue. Il était là depuis toujours... Comment ai-je pu le rater ?",
        "523383602810613760": "Mais ce n'est peut-être pas le cas. Il a pu être façonné par une architecture quantique. Ça voudrait dire qu'il pourrait être là en cet instant précis et disparaître en un éclair l'instant d'après... ou même être présent et absent en même temps.",
        "523383603599142912": "Après tout, j'utilise moi-même assez souvent la technologie quantique. Il serait malavisé de négliger cette possibilité.",

        "523383615057981440": "Je n'avais jamais été aussi haut, et je n'avais jamais vu autant de choses du vaste monde. Toute ma vie s'était déroulée autour de ma maison, et là, je pouvais voir... tout. La forêt recouvrant Far, Far Ouest, les oiseaux volant au-dessus...",

Un équilibre s'est brisé, et quand j'ai essayé d'y remédier, je n'ai fait qu'empirer les choses. J'ai appelé les mauvaises personnes à l'aide, et elles ont essayé d'exploiter la situation. ",

        "528371269646315520": "C'est là que tu interviens. Les harmoniseurs que tu as activés émettent une impulsion énergétique particulière qui se répercute dans tout le Dédale. Ils forment de concert une sorte de vague d'énergie harmonieuse qui, lorsqu'elle est dirigée vers le Prismacœur, tente de le modifier de la même façon.",

        "528374290384056320": "Dès que tu es prête, je superpose les fréquences de l'harmoniseur sur le Prismacœur. Cela provoquera d'incroyables perturbations et plongera le Prismacœur dans un état de chaos jusqu'à ce que nous puissions le stabiliser.\r\n",
        "528374334084509696": "Ce chaos aura un impact sur le monde qui nous entoure. Il pourrait bien transformer par exemple les slimes en horribles goudrrons. Si on les laisse proliférer ici, ils vont tout détruire.",
        "528374369555738624": "Il faut que tu détruises tous les goudrrons avant qu'ils ne déstabilisent le Prismacœur, car les conséquences seraient terribles. Normalement, l'eau ne reste pas longtemps dans son état ici. Elle se transforme en verre à proximité du Prismacœur.",
        "528374611244118016": "Comme les harmoniseurs résonnent dans l'eau qui coule à présent, tu dois t'en emparer le plus vite possible et éliminer ces goudrrons !",

        "528422630249361408": "C'est ça ! J'étais persuadée que l'accès était dissimulé, et qu'il fallait trouver une porte ou un truc dans le genre. Je vais essayer de concevoir un appareil pour tester cette théorie.",

        "528428360129998848": "L'avenir nous le dira, mais je pense qu'il peut rester ici comme une autre partie de ce monde que nous appelons tous notre maison. Les humains n'ont jamais fait partie de ce monde jusqu'à notre arrivée, et maintenant regarde ! Nous avons réussi à faire partie de ce monde sans le détruire.",
        "528428517668057088": "Même le Prismacœur était perdu dans le vide de l'espace avant d'atterrir ici, et maintenant, il fait aussi partie de ce monde. Il doit trouver sa vraie place dans tout ça... tout comme moi.",

        "108799766553817115": "В общем, пока говорили, мы начали играть в го. Так я мог и дальше тестировать его интеллект, а он наверняка как-нибудь и мой.",
        "108799766553817116": "Иногда эти игры длились до самой ночи. Как и наши разговоры, которые звучали всё более и более естественно, хотя я знал, что говорил с существом, состоящим лишь из сложного набора кодов.",
        "108799766553817117": "И вот однажды на рассвете мой собеседник предложил сыграть ещё одну партию. Я сказал: «Конечно, но сначала сделаю себе чашечку кофе, чтобы не заснуть...»",
        "108799766553817118": "...и он ответил: «Я тоже».",
        "108799766553817119": "Я просто уставился на экран, не зная, как реагировать. И вдруг, будто поняв, что сейчас натворил, он отключился.",
        "108799766553817120": "С тех пор я больше ничего не получал от... них. Но очень надеюсь.",
        "108799766553817121": "А пока я буду ждать и займу себя работой, как обычно: продолжу задавать всё те же вопросы без ответов. Рядом с доской для го, готовой к новой партии... вдруг когда-нибудь.",
        "108799766553817122": "До свидания, Беатрикс. Надеюсь, скоро ещё пообщаемся.",
        "108799766553817123": "Привет, Беатрикс. Надеюсь, это прозвучит не слишком самонадеянно, но у меня есть для тебя вот это. Эм, и надеюсь, тебе понравится.",
        "108799766553817124": "Обычно выбрать подходящий подарок мне помогает алгоритм, но в данном случае я вроде как... сымпровизировал.",
        "108799766553817125": "Согласен, такая спонтанность меня тоже пугает.",
        "108799766553817126": "Беатрикс! Мне нужны от тебя данные. Я провожу эксперимент: исследую, какие психологические последствия вызывает получение подарка.",
        "108799766553817127": "Пожалуйста, скажи, что ты испытываешь: благодарность, радость или, может быть... голод?",
        "108799766553817128": "Прошу, не ешь мой подарок.",
        "108799766553817129": "О, Беатрикс, я не спал всю ночь, пытаясь синтезировать идеальный подарок для тебя. Всё строил гипотезы, тестировал, выбрасывал результаты в мусорное ведро, начинал всё заново...",
        "108799766553817130": "И наконец обнаружил альтернативный метод — купить что-то онлайн.",
        "108799766553817131": "Процесс был поразительно прост.",
        "108799766553817132": "Привет, Беатрикс. Хотел выразить благодарность за твою отзывчивость с первого дня нашего знакомства. Я правда считаю, что с твоей помощью стал лучше.",
        "108799766553817133": "Согласно моему исследованию, дарить мелкие безделушки обычно уместно. Поэтому, пожалуйста, прими это.",
        "108799766553817134": "А, Беатрикс. Я убирался в лаборатории и нашёл это. Возможно, тебе пригодится. Кажется, он всё ещё работает.",
        "108799766553817135": "Знаешь, как говорится, что для одного — мусор, для другого — сделанный наспех подарочек. Наслаждайся!",
        "108799766553817136": "О, привет. Должен сказать, когда я увидел эту вещицу, она просто кричала: «Беатрикс!»",
        "108799766553817137": "...И тут я понял, что случайно задел её Лучом разума. Но не волнуйся, всё уже хорошо и в полном порядке.",
        "108799766553817138": "Но всё равно думаю, тебе надо такую же. Наслаждайся!",
        "108799766553817139": "Сожалею, Беатрикс, но я сейчас занят. Если быть точным, то занят я конфликтом тостера с моей стиральной машиной.",
        "108799766553817140": "Я вернулся к экспериментам с робототехникой, и всё идёт довольное неплохо!",
        "108799766553817141": "Прими мои извинения, Беатрикс, но в настоящее время у меня нет возможности участвовать в разговоре, болтовне, обсуждении и даже балагане.",
        "108799766553817142": "Может, в другой раз?",
        "108799766553817143": "Привет, Беатрикс! Не верь своим глазам, это не Виктор, а голограмма Виктора, разработанная Виктором для получения сообщений для Виктора, который не я.",
        "108799766553817144": "Пожалуйста, изложи своё сообщение, и я обязательно передам его не себе, а Виктору.",
        "108799766553817145": "И кто бы мог подумать? Беатрикс Лебо укатила в очередное путешествие и даже не подумала взять с собой милого дружочка, иногда соперника, но своего наставника навеки, Моти Майлз?",
        "108799766553817146": "Серьёзно, Беа, когда в следующий раз сбежишь туда, где опасно и ничего не ясно, можешь хоть дать мне знать?",
        "108799766553817147": "Хотелось бы быть начеку, вдруг понадоблюсь...",
        "108799766553817148": "...помочь собрать всяких важных ресурсов, которыми остров, похоже, просто усеян.",
        "108799766553817149": "Что? Думаешь, я не могла сама выбраться на небольшую разведку? Что толку от спутников слежения, если они не умеют подглядывать?",
        "108799766553817150": "...",
        "108799766553817151": "Короче, будь там осторожнее. У меня странные предчувствия насчёт этого острова. Так что я тут ещё пошарюсь.",
        "108799766553817152": "О, и раз уж ты там начинаешь всё с нуля, можешь взять этот коллектор преобразователя. Так будет полегче. Просто запишу его на твой счёт. Чао-какао.",
        "108799766553817153": "Эй, Беа, эти твои дроны, которые ты находишь по всему острову... есть в них что-то странное.",
        "108799766553817154": "М?",
        "108799766553817155": "Эй, у меня теперь есть глаза в небе, и я собираюсь ими воспользоваться. Ещё готовлюсь отправить туда кучку дронов и проверить всё своими силами, но что-то я отвлеклась...",
        "108799766553817156": "В общем, тот дрон какой-то суперсовременный — типа, нечто вроде инопланетной технологии. Ну ладно, сначала думаю: «Окей, где-то там инопланетяне изучают Радужный остров, прямо как ты». Но нет, вряд ли.",
        "108799766553817157": "Ну потому, что эти дроны слишком похожи на наших... и при этом я будто уже видела такие. У меня даже какое-то дежавю. И это жутковато!",
        "108799766553817158": "Эй, не пугайся. Это наверняка всего лишь инопланетяне. Гигантские трёхголовые пришельцы с огромными когтями ищут людей и забирают к себе. Или поедают. Или И ТО И ДРУГОЕ.",
        "108799766553817159": "Пха-ха-ха-ха!",
        "108799766553817160": "Чао, Беа.",
        "108799766553817161": "Беа! Всё никак не могу достучаться до тебя. Я изучила одного из дронов с этого твоего острова и поняла, почему он выглядит так знакомо: он мой.",
        "108799766553817162": "Или как минимум я видела такого раньше... в своих мечтах, может быть.",
        "108799766553817163": "Я просканировала его и только убедилась в этом. Тогда взялась просмотреть свои старые слаймонаучные дневники. В основном там описаны проекты будущего, но попадаются и теоретически возможные технологии.",
        "108799766553817164": "Ты же меня знаешь, я всегда думаю на шесть шагов вперёд, чтобы Моти-Тек оставались лидерами индустрии. Ну, иногда и просто фантазирую о том, что наверняка не создам за всю свою жизнь.",
        "108799766553817165": "Вот и найденные дроны как раз из этой песни: нереальны при нынешних технологиях и взяты прямо со страниц моих дневников. Я могла только мечтать о них, Беа!",
        "108799766553817166": "И как же кучка невозможных дронов, которых я придумала, выбралась со страниц моих дневников и добралась до Радужного острова?",
        "108799766553817167": "...",
        "108799766553817168": "Может... может, внутри них есть какой-нибудь архив и нам удастся разблокировать его и что-то выяснить. Конечно, там хранятся логи данных, но если это была я... ну, я всегда найду способ скрыть то, что нужно скрыть...",
        "108799766553817169": "Ладно, Беа, мне нужно немного подумать. Выйду на связь, если что-нибудь соображу. Ну, или утро вечера мудренее...",
        "108799766553817170": "Эй, Беа, могу предложить тебе кое-что попробовать. И честно говоря, если это сработает, то я струхну не на шутку.",
        "108799766553817171": "Я нарисовала чертёж ключа — специально от архивов в дронах, которых ты находишь. Если там есть хоть какие-то данные, этот ключ должен открыть к ним доступ.",
        "108799766553817172": "Я говорю «должен», потому что на самом деле понятия не имею. Но если это правда дроны со страниц моих дневников и мне бы удалось их однажды создать, что ж, таким ключом я бы и открыла их архивы.",
        "108799766553817173": "Понимаю, не слишком-то разумно всё это выглядит, но ты должна попробовать. Если сработает, и архив существует, и ты побольше узнаешь о том, что происходит на острове...",
        "108799766558011392": "...что ж, тогда я рада, что смогла помочь тебе. Я ведь всё ещё твой должник, так?",
        "108799766558011393": "Уф. Я этого не говорила! Сделай уже этот дурацкий ключ и пока даже не заикайся о том, работает он или нет.",
        "108799766558011394": "Ведь если работает, то я совсем не уверена, что готова услышать это.",
        "108799766558011395": "Чао-какао. И удачи.",
        "108799766558011396": "Эй, Беа, я тут нашла кое-что и собиралась уже выбросить, как вдруг пришла мысль: «Стой, а Беа же любит всякий древний хлам, который для меня бесполезен. Спорю, она будет просто в восторге».",
        "108799766558011397": "Можешь поблагодарить позже.",
        "108799766558011398": "Приве-е-ет, Беатрикс! Угадаешь, кто самый большой везунчик во всей галактике?",
        "108799766558011399": "ТЫ! Ведь тебя ждёт подарок от САМОЙ Моти Майлз!",
        "108799766558011400": "Дам тебе время уложить это в голове. Поди присядь, если надо.",
        "108799766558011401": "Эй, Беа, не ты недавно сказала, что хочешь больше всякой всячины?",
        "108799766558011402": "Хм-м... Стой-ка, это вроде была я.",
        "108799766558011403": "Ну и ладно, вот порадуйся, тут тебе ещё всякого.",
        "108799766558011404": "Эй, Беа, у меня для тебя подарочек, потому что... ну, не знаю. Короче, пусть тебе понравится.",
        "108799766558011405": "Или нет... да неважно.",
        "108799766558011406": "Йоушки, Беа, я у меня есть маленький сюрприз — ударение на «маленький».",
        "108799766558011407": "Ведь для себя-то я достала кое-что ПОКРУПНЕЕ. И это намного лучше.",
        "108799766558011408": "Беа, извини, не могу говорить, ужасно занята безумно важными делами.",
        "108799766558011409": "Ну, типа, они куда важнее того, что ты хотела, прости. И мне некогда слушать, как у тебя дела.",
        "108799766558011410": "Но всё же хорошо, верно?",
        "108799766558011411": "Беа, извини, я опаздываю на встречу и кстати как тебе моя причёска шучу она всегда идеальна мне пора пока-а-а!!!",
        "108799766558011412": "Ух, ты ещё пожалеешь, что перешла дорогу Моти Майлз, вот подожди, по...",
        "108799766558011413": "Ой, Беа! Прости, думала, это была другая линия. Я тут улаживаю кое-какие дела с одним конкурентом. Ничего такого, просто дружеская беседа.",
        "108799766558011414": "Ола, Беатрикс! Ты там? Это я, Огден Ортис!",
        "108799766558011415": "Слышал, ты бросилась навстречу новому большому приключению на таинственном острове, где много загадок, опасностей и, может, даже суккулентных фруктов и овощей, каких мир ещё не видывал?..",
        "108799766558011416": "Ну ты же знала, я не мог не спросить! С тех пор как ты начала стабильно приносить мне фрукты кукадобы, я достиг таких высот в кулинарии Далёкого-Далёкого Запределья!",
        "108799766558011417": "...А ещё просто объе-е-елся пирогов с кукадобой, суфле из кукадобы, пудинга из кукадобы, кукадобового кон карне, кукадобовой кон... кукадобы. ",
        "108799766558011418": "У меня закончились идеи... и сила воли.",
        "108799766558011419": "Так что если увидишь что-нибудь новенькое, прошу, расскажи мне всё. Кроме вкусняшек, я хочу узнать больше о тамошней флоре и фауне.",
        "108799766558011420": "И никогда не забывай: каждая частичка этого дикого мира бесценна и заслуживает нашей заботы и уважения.",
        "108799766558011421": "А ещё почаще пей там водичку! Все эти приключалочки заставят попотеть, так что прихвати с собой этот водопроводный кран.",
        "108799766558011422": "Удачки, Беатрикс. Держи меня в курсе. Болею за тебя!",
        "108799766558011423": "Беатрикс! Рад, что ты позвонила.",
        "108799766558011424": "Мне пришли твои фото Радужного острова, я просмотрел их. Несомненно, такое стоит увидеть! Красота, и чем дольше смотришь, тем богаче выглядит палитра...",
        "108799766558011425": "...однако это неестественно. Мне жаль, но что-то с этим местом не так.",
        "108799766558011426": "Если помнишь, когда-то я был главой одного очень успешного производителя мгновенного питания. Мы создавали генно-модифицированные продукты.",
        "108799766558011427": "Я не горжусь тем, на что мы пошли, лишь бы натуральные продукты росли крупнее и быстрее, а стоили дешевле: мы лишили их полезных свойств в угоду прибыли.",
        "108799766558011428": "Беатрикс, я говорю так потому, что ещё могу определить на глаз, когда растение было искусственно изменено. И прекрасные радужные разводы этого острова перед твоими глазами появились не сами собой.",
        "108799766558011429": "Точно не знаю, таится ли здесь какая-то опасность для тебя, но у меня от всего этого появилось неприятное чувство в животе. Я должен провести побольше исследований и позже вернусь.",
        "108799766558011430": "Будь осторожна, амига.",
        "108799766558011431": "О-О-О-А-А-А-А-А-А-А-А",
        "108799766558011432": "Ой, ло сьенто, Беатрикс! Последние несколько долгих ночей я провёл за чтением.",
        "108799766558011433": "А точнее, я просмотрел каждый полевой справочник и все ботанические исследовательские работы о Далёком-Далёком Запределье, какие смог накопать.",
        "108799766558011434": "Думал, даже если флора Радужного острова имеет искусственное происхождение, то об этом могли написать где-нибудь и заодно сообщить что-то, что нам пригодится.",
        "108799766558011435": "А оказалось, ничего нет. Нигде ни одного упоминания о радужных растениях. Значит, то, что произошло с островом и сделало его таким, было относительно недавно.",
        "108799766558011436": "Хотя не думаю, что надо тебе это рассказывать, ведь ты наверняка всё видела сама. То, что ты описывала, та огромная часть острова, разделённая на два цвета прямо посередине...",
        "108799766558011437": "...По мне, так это говорит о какой-то катастрофе, Беатрикс.",
        "108799766558011438": "Так что ступай осторожно. Природа бывает опасна для нас, но это не сравнится с тем, что мы способны с ней сделать.",
        "108799766558011439": "Я ещё пороюсь в своей библиотеке, вдруг найду что-нибудь полезное для тебя. А если не выгорит, то хотя бы напеку для тебя маффинов!",
        "108799766558011440": "Но в любом случае те тенго, Беатрикс. Адьос!",
        "108799766558011441": "Ола, Беатрикс! Рад тебя видеть. Очень надеюсь, что ты о себе не забываешь и находишь время набить пузико перед каждым новым спуском в неизведанное.",
        "108799766558011442": "И я так понимаю, интрига всё закручивается и густеет, как хороший соус, и ты натолкнулась на некие монолитные структуры на дальнем конце острова?",
        "108799766558011443": "Страшная штука! Но вероятно, это значит, что моё чутьё не обмануло и вся эта странная флора действительно не естественного происхождения...",
        "108799766558011444": "Кое-что не сходится, Беатрикс. Мы уже находили руины на Далёком-Далёком Запределье, но никогда не замечали, чтобы какие-то из них могли причинять вред окружающей среде.",
        "108799766558011445": "Конечно, нам неизвестно, для чего и кем они построены, но меня никогда не покидало ощущение, что те люди почитали этот мир.",
        "108799766558011446": "Однако всякое могло случиться. Бывает, в походе перешагиваешь через один цветок, стараясь не раздавить его, но оттого наступаешь на другой.",
        "108799766558011447": "Иногда единственный способ дать цветку расти дальше — это никогда не приближаться к нему.",
        "108799766558011448": "Но не всё так безотрадно и беспроглядно: похоже, пока Радужный остров цветёт и пахнет. Природа умеет найти баланс, но ничего не обещает.",
        "108799766558011449": "Ах! Посмотрите на меня, взялся уж поучать тебя. Ло сьенто, Беатрикс. Не держу тебя.",
        "108799766558011450": "Не знаю, что ждёт тебя за теми стенами, но я доверяю твоим сапогам в любом саду. Ты всё сделаешь правильно, не сомневаюсь в тебе.",
        "108799766558011451": "Удачи, Беатрикс.",
        "108799766558011452": "Эй, амига! У меня для тебя маленький подарочек. Он не домашнего приготовления, и это не пирог, и это не пирог домашнего приготовления...",
        "108799766558011453": "...но я подумал, что тебе всё равно понравится. Хотя жалко, что это не пирог...",
        "108799766558011454": "Ола, Беа! Я купил для тебя кое-что, что может тебе там пригодиться.",
        "108799766558011455": "Но если у тебя уже есть такое, вернуть его я не смогу, так что... чем больше, тем лучше, так ведь?",
        "108799766558011456": "Эй, Беа, у меня есть для тебя нечто особенное! В тот момент казалось, что это будет как нельзя кстати...",
        "108799766558011457": "Ох, а теперь я не уверен. Эм, если нет, пожалуйста, не говори мне. Не выдержу, если узнаю!",
        "108799766558011458": "Беа, если я что и знаю о твоей одинокой жизни исследователя, так это что никогда не бывает лишним напомнить, как часто твои друзья думают о тебе.",
        "108799766558011459": "Поэтому вот моё напоминание!.. В виде подарка. Пусть он навевает мысли обо мне и всех тех моментах, которые мы провели вместе. Чао, Беа!",
        "108799766558011460": "Эй, амига, как ты себя там чувствуешь? Когда мне одиноко, я выбираюсь из дома и делаю что-нибудь приятное для друга — это всегда бодрит, как летний дождичек!",
        "108799766558011461": "Это мой робкий способ сказать, что я беспокоюсь о тебе.",
        "108799766558011462": "Беа, прости, не могу поболтать! Все мои кур-курицы разлетелись из курятника! У меня здесь настоящий пернатый бунт! Если до завтра не отвечу, значит, они меня свергли.",
        "108799766558011463": "Ло сьенто, Беа, но сейчас мне нужно достать из духовки большущее суфле, и это потребует от меня предельной концентрации.",
        "108799766558011464": "А после я буду есть большущее суфле, и это потребует от меня предельной концентрации.",
        "108799766558011465": "Эй, амига, не могу говорить: хлопот полон рот. Особенно салатиком с чудным лучком, который как раз на пике спелости.",
        "108799766558011466": "Для этого мне пришлось съесть столько моркови, что теперь я не упущу своё!",
        "108799766558011467": "Ну надо же, да не Беатрикс Лебо ли это? Мы со стариком Гобби как раз говорили о тебе. Ходит молва, что ты вырвалась с этого самого булыжника в земли неведомые, неизвестные нам тут, да жаждешь новых приключений?",
        "108799766558011468": "Ай да девчонка! Просто шагает вперёд и ищет, какие новые чудеса ждут дальше за углом, пока ботинки не прохудятся. А потом купит себе новую пару — и опять за своё!",
        "108799766558011469": "Мои-то сапоги знавали лучшие времена, но ещё переживём мы с ними пару приключений, обязательно. Поди ж, хорошо бы сначала решить куда...",
        "108799766558011470": "Ай, чёрт-те что, брежу, как Гобсон, когда заводит эти свои разговорчики об исследованиях, космосе, стряпне и... да почти на любую тему.",
        "108799766558011471": "Ну ладно, Беа, ты держись там. А я буду звонить, буду спрашивать, как ты. Любой ведь почувствует, как дом скроется за горизонтом.",
        "108799766558011472": "Ой, пока не забыла: вот мой небольшой вклад в красоту на твоём новом месте. Мелочь, конечно, но тебе надо постараться и сделать всё возможное, чтобы твой новый дом стал уютнее.",
        "108799766558011473": "Здорово, Беа! Как житьё-бытьё на Радужном острове? Боже, это даже звучит весело. Наверняка не скучаешь!",
        "108799766558011474": "Видишь ты, какие дела: с тех пор как услышала, что ты задумала что-то новенькое, я пораскинула мозгами о собственной жизни, о том, что «новенького» будет у меня.",
        "108799766558011475": "Мы с Гобсоном к своим годкам столько повидали да сделали, пережили одно приключение за другим на этом пыльном булыжнике. Даже после знакомства ничуть не сбавили темп.",
        "108799766558011476": "И теперь нас потянуло в новое путешествие — уже вместе. Но пока не решили, какое и куда.",
        "108799766558011477": "Может, как ты, двинемся исследовать какой-нибудь потаённый уголок Далёкого-Далёкого Запределья или даже устремимся к звёздам, как однажды сделал Гобсон.",
        "108799766558011478": "Да неважно, что порешим, всё равно это путешествие станет исключительным, ведь теперь-то мы проживём его рука об руку. Именно поэтому оно будет куда более захватывающим!",
        "108799766558011479": "В нашем мире так трудно отыскать кого-то, кто полностью подойдёт тебе. Это такая редкость — как найти две одинаковые снежинки в пустыне.",
        "108799766558011480": "...Знаю, ты чувствуешь это отчётливее, чем я смогу объяснить.",
        "108799766558011481": "Я всегда буду держать в уме мысль о том, как мне повезло, Беа. Хочу воспользоваться дарами, которые Вселенная сочла нужным дать мне.",
        "108799766558011482": "...",
        "108799766558011483": "А ты не вешай нос, девочка. Покалякаем ещё чуть позже.",
        "108799766558011484": "О, Беа, хорошо, что застала тебя. У меня есть важные новости, а на этом булыжнике не так много людей, кому можно присесть на уши.",
        "108799766558011485": "Мы с Гобсоном долго думали, каким быть нашему следующему приключению. Почитали путевые дневники друг друга, попытались выяснить, куда никто из нас ещё не добирался.",
        "108799766558011486": "Но когда мы нашли такие места, ни одно из них не привлекло нас по-настоящему. Может, наша жизнь наконец замедлилась?",
        "108799766558011487": "Тогда мы потолковали и поняли, что ничто не полюбится нам сейчас больше, чем вот эта наша жизнь друг с другом здесь, на моём ранчо.",
        "108799766558011488": "Это ранчо было одним из первых на Далёком-Далёком Запределье, и с тех пор мы оба многому научились... а потому заговорили о том, что всё, что имеем, возможно, однажды передадим кому-то...",
        "108799766558011489": "...так что мы с Гобсоном решили создать семью, Беа. И вот впервые с тех пор, как себя помню, я оробела!",
        "108799766558011490": "Мы с Гобсоном настолько независимы, что знать не знаем ничегошеньки о том, как быть родителями. Я уж не говорю о воспитании ребёнка на Далёком-Далёком Запределье.",
        "108799766558011491": "Но я люблю этого старого сумасброда, и одна мысль о том, что малыш будет смотреть на меня его глазами, вызывает у меня улыбку...",
        "108799766558011492": "Наверное, уже этого достаточно, чтобы я почувствовала в себе силы свернуть горы, лишь бы это произошло.",
        "108799766558011493": "Так что мне есть над чем поработать и тут. Столько всего нужно привести в порядок!",
        "108799766558011494": "Спасибо, что выслушала, Беа. Иногда просто поделишься с кем-то своими страхами — и уже как будто не один на один со своей тревогой.",
        "108799766558011495": "Береги себя, Беа.",
        "108799766558011496": "Приветик, Беа, как твои исследования? Ходит молва, что ты там по уши в загадках. Звучит, конечно, захватывающе!",
        "108799766558011497": "Боже правый, ну почему всё детское нужно так усложнять! Карабкаться по горам было проще, чем собрать кроватку таким крошечным шестигранным ключиком, который тебе дают...",
        "108799766558011498": "Но вообще-то мы с Гобсоном просто хотели поблагодарить тебя. Думаю, не будь тебя в нашей жизни, мы так и не осознали бы, что хотим ребятёнка.",
        "108799766558011499": "Я всегда видела в тебе частичку себя, а когда ты возродила старое пыльное ранчо Гобсона, мы поняли, что важно не только оставить свой след в этом мире, но презабавно даже поглазеть, что со всем этим сделает молодёжь.",
        "108799766558011500": "Поэтому будет очень приятно посмотреть, во что наш малыш превратит это ранчо или куда его приведёт сердце.",
        "108799766558011501": "Так что спасибо большое, Беа. Мы с Гобсоном стали лучше оттого, что ты прожила частичку нашей жизни вместе с нами. Желаю и тебе всего самого лучшего и всегда буду желать.",
        "108799766558011502": "Ой, и ещё одно...",
        "108799766558011503": "Гобсон интересовался, почему ты решила не трогать то здоровенное древнее устройство в руинах Стеклянной пустыни и не отправилась в какое-нибудь грандиозное путешествие через весь космос?",
        "108799766558011504": "Я говорила ему: «Гобсон Твиллгерс, женщине самой решать, путешествовать сквозь пространство и время или нет, и это только её выбор». Но он упёрт и любопытен, просто неисправимый человек.",
        "108799766558011505": "...Хм?",
        "108799766558011506": "Оно было сломано? Звучит не очень... Гобсон сказал, что та штука была в полной готовности, когда он ушёл. И что оставил дверь открытой для следующей отважной души.",
        "108799766558011507": "Так-так, Беатрикс Лебо... похоже, только что ты сама обнаружила ещё одну загадку.",
        "108799766558011508": "Удачи тебе с ней, Беа! Может, когда всё закончится, ты напишешь собственную книгу об этом. А получилась бы отличная история о приключениях, чёрт побери!",
        "108799766562205696": "Привет, Беа. Хотела сделать для тебя что-нибудь приятное и попыталась приготовить печенье, но, уф, я не мастер выпечки...",
        "108799766562205697": "Гобсон сказал, они были очень, очень, о-о-очень... съедобны.",
        "108799766562205698": "...Забудь, я купила кое-что взамен. Надеюсь, тебе понравится!",
        "108799766562205699": "Знаешь, Беа, говорят, лучшие подарки идут от сердца.",
        "108799766562205700": "Этот пришёл из магазина... но почти ведь то же самое, да?",
        "108799766562205701": "Эй, Беа, знаю, это глупости всё, но я беспокоюсь, что тебе там в одиночку приходится так тяжело трудиться...",
        "108799766562205702": "Поэтому я отправила тебе небольшую посылку с частичкой своей заботы. Пусть она чуток поднимет дух!",
        "108799766562205703": "Ха-ха-ха, не волнуйся, я передам ей! Тихо, она на связи!",
        "108799766562205704": "Эй, Беа, Гобсон хотел передать тебе это... говорит, если не понадобится, то хоть будет чем разжечь костёр!",
        "108799766562205705": "Всегда рада слышать тебя, дорогуша, но мне надо смотаться за Гобсоном: трактор снова сломался в поле. Передам ему от тебя привет!",
        "108799766562205706": "Беа, боюсь, не могу сейчас поболтать. У меня тут бушует буря, как и мой кофе на плите. И то и другое требует моего внимания. Мне пора!",
        "108799766562205707": "Прости, Беа, мне нужно освободить линию для Гобсона. Он тут любит почесать языком с каким-то другом целый день бог знает о чём. А тот — странный парень в плаще. Ума не приложу, чего они там.",

        "434160855480430592": "Если увидишь их, попробуй подкрасться к ним незаметно и выбить как можно больше плортов до того, как они убегут. Так что не забудь прихватить мусор в своем вакпаке на такой случай.",
        "434160855937609728": "Только не пытайся согнать одного из них с уступа. Разумеется, я говорю это не из собственного опыта... уф.",
        "434160856415760384": "Послушай, Беатрикс, герой из меня никакой. Чтобы остановить то, что здесь происходит, мне нужен настоящий герой.",
        "434160856881328128": "Герой... которому я могу доверять. И если не ты, то кто? Я пыталась представить идеального кандидата на эту роль, и ты полностью подходишь.",
        "434160857334312960": "Мое доверие уже предавали. Именно из-за этого все пошло не так. Я поверила не тем людям. Но сейчас у меня появился шанс все исправить.",
        "434160857791492096": "Возможно, ты пока в это не веришь, но ты герой, Беатрикс. Или очень скоро станешь им. Я обещаю, тебя ждет много классных приключений!",
        "434160858261254144": "Со временем это станет еще одной главой в «Приключениях Беатрикс Лебо». Историей, которой зачитывается девочка под деревом, мечтая, что и ее жизнь будет так же эпична.",
        "434160858726821888": "Всегда рада пролить свет на то, что тебе нужно.",
        "434166468247711744": "Очень легко потеряться в мыслях, любуясь этой причудливой архитектурой и задаваясь вопросом, откуда все это взялось, правда?",
        "434166470726545408": "Как думаешь, кто все это построил?",
        "434166471175335936": "А ты, Джиджи? Откуда ты?",
        "434166471632515072": "Думаю, мне пора выдвигаться.",
        "434166472085499904": "В Далёком-Далёком Запределье много свидетельств того, что когда-то давно кто-то или что-то здесь обитало. По всей планете разбросаны развалины и остатки древних технологических устройств.",
        "434166472546873344": "Эти развалины всегда ставили меня в тупик. У них нет какого-то практического назначения, по крайней мере в нашем понимании. Не говоря уже обо всех этих статуях слаймов повсюду!",
        "434166473004052480": "Но лабиринт совсем другой. Его-то как раз построили с определенной целью.",
        "434166473478008832": "И что это за цель?",
        "434166473964548096": "Я думаю, призма-ядро обнаружили очень давно, и этот лабиринт — не что иное, как научно-исследовательская база, которую построили вокруг него.",
        "434166474417532928": "У них не вышло остановить действие призма-ядра, поэтому они просто пытались не допустить его воздействия на остальную часть Далёкого-Далёкого Запределья, пока искали решение.",
        "434166474862129152": "Лабиринт был спроектирован как самодостаточная экосистема. Я думаю, это было сделано для того, чтобы смоделировать части Радужного острова и посмотреть, что ядро сделает с ним со временем.",
        "434166475315113984": "За пределами Лабиринта тебе попадались лишь цветовые изменения, но внутри, где ядро имеет больше силы, свойства элементов полностью меняются.",
        "434166475772293120": "Мы придумаем, как это остановить.",
        "434166476250443776": "Со временем придумаем. Всему требуется время...",
        "434166476711817216": "Наверное, это сложный вопрос. На самом деле, я из места, которое не так уж и далеко от того, что ты сейчас называешь домом. Но мы бы не пересеклись до этого момента.",
        "434166477168996352": "Я родилась в Далёком-Далёком Запределье. Это мой дом, и это всё, что я когда-либо знала, помимо книг.",
        "434166477621981184": "Поэтому, когда я впервые открыла для себя Радужный остров, это было что-то совершенно новое, словно я нашла секретную комнату в доме своего детства. Мне хотелось остаться там навсегда.",
        "434166478079160320": "Но теперь у меня такое чувство, будто я прожила много жизней. Мое детство было одной из них, а моя жизнь на Радужном острове — другой. И теперь, когда я вернулась, — еще одна. Но как-то все размыто.",
        "434166478590865408": "О чем ты?",
        "434166479039655936": "То, как мне удалось вернуться, получить еще один шанс исправить происходящее... ну, это не было обычной прогулкой. И теперь моя голова всегда немного затуманена, немного запутана.",
        "434166479530389504": "Воспоминания, которые у меня остались, теперь как будто перемешались, они не в том порядке. Иногда то, что я делала вчера, кажется таким далеким, как полузабытые события из моего детства...",
        "434166479983374336": "А сами детские воспоминания внезапно становятся кристально ясными, иногда даже кажутся новыми.",
        "434166480478302208": "Мое самое раннее воспоминание всегда было о том, как я сидела под обеденным столом и смотрела, как мама пылесосит гостиную. Она не видела меня, а я просто наблюдала за ней.",
        "434166480927092736": "Помню, что был жаркий день, и она выглядела уставшей и чем-то расстроенной. И на этом всё.",
        "434166481380077568": "Но после моего возвращения воспоминание изменилось. Я все так же сижу под столом, и мама так же пылесосит. День жаркий, и она устала...",
        "434166481862422528": "Но тут она замечает меня. И ее лицо озаряется удивлением и радостью. Она выключает пылесос.",
        "434166482319601664": "Она опускается на колени, и мы о чем-то разговариваем, но я не слышу собственных слов. Я просто вижу, как она слушает и улыбается.",
        "434166482772586496": "Удачи в исследовании!",
        "434169717507911680": "Какой потрясающий вид... так бы и любовалась вечно. Точнее, до тех пор, пока призматический разрыв не перевернет все вверх дном.",
        "434169719974162432": "Да, ориентироваться здесь и без них достаточно сложно.",
        "434169720464896000": "Я тоже так подумала, поэтому и начала разработку устройства, которое должно с этим помочь.",
        "434169720938852352": "Я назвала его детектором разрывов, что он собственно и делает. Размести их в разных точках лабиринта, и они предупредят о надвигающемся призматическом разрыве. Они отображаются на твоей карте!",
        "434169721408614400": "Я дам тебе тот, что сделала сама, а также чертеж, чтобы ты могла изготовить столько, сколько нужно.",
        "434169721878376448": "Расскажи ещё раз, как пользоваться детектором.",
        "434169722331361280": "Как мне получить призма-плорты?",
        "434169722817900544": "Мне пора идти.",
        "434169723275079680": "Не волнуйся, у меня тоже иногда каша в голове. Это один из побочных эффектов, ну...",
        "434169723770007552": "В общем, использовать детектор разрывов очень легко. Просто изготовь его и установи в той области лабиринта, где хочешь отслеживать призматические разрывы.",
        "434169724218798080": "После установки он начнет показывать, случится ли призматический разрыв в скором времени или уже происходит в данный момент.",
        "434169724671782912": "Призма-плорты можно во время хаотичных призматических разрывов, которые возникают по всему лабиринту. Призматические разрывы вызывают излучения призматической энергии в области действия, которые усиливаются со временем.",
        "434169725158322176": "Во время этих разрывов на земле ты увидишь еду, ставшую нестабильной из-за воздействия призма-ядра. Если накормить ей слаймов, они начнут производить нестабильные плорты.",
        "434169725653250048": "Нестабильные плорты? Как их стабилизировать?",
        "434169726093651968": "Нестабильные плорты можно стабилизировать до состояния призма-плортов с помощью стабилизаторов, которые ты найдешь в лабиринте. Они бывают двух видов.",
        "434169726567608320": "Первые — это древние, похожие на кольца стабилизаторы в отдаленных частях лабиринта. Они большие, и их трудно не заметить.",
        "434169727016398848": "Вторые — это эфирные временные стабилизаторы, которые случайным образом появляются в виде маленьких золотых колец энергии во время призматических разрывов. Эти разрывы хаотичны, так что смотри в оба.",
        "434169727490355200": "Запусти нестабильный плорт в любое из колец — и получишь призма-плорт. Через древний стабилизатор можешь прыгнуть сама, и тогда все плорты стабилизируются разом. Это весело!",
        "434169727981088768": "Удачи в исследовании!",
        "434189984019935232": "Похоже, у тебя здорово получается находить секреты. У меня ушла целая вечность на то, чтобы найти это место.",
        "434189987203411968": "Похоже, тут все состоит из секретов.",
        "434189987656396800": "Кстати о секретах. Почему ты притворилась искусственным интеллектом?",
        "434189988105187328": "Перейдем к следующему секрету...",
        "434189988549783552": "Похоже, так оно и есть. Я подозреваю, что местами планировка кажется странной, потому что лабиринт достраивался с течением времени. Приходилось разрабатывать более креативные решения, чтобы сделать его больше, чем было возможно изначально.",
        "434189989002768384": "Креативные решения?",
        "434189989472530432": "Знаешь, почему лабиринт внутри кажется больше, чем снаружи? Я думаю, что это была технология, каким-то образом заимствованная из самого призма-ядра.",
        "434189989963264000": "Потому что, как безумно бы это ни звучало, энергия ядра в своей наиболее концентрированной форме способна изменить саму реальность.",
        "434189990416248832": "Думаю, лабиринт расширили, чтобы удержать энергию ядра, а когда это не сработало, применили какую-то технологию изменения реальности, чтобы сделать его еще больше.",
        "434189990873427968": "Но затем в какой-то момент все пошло наперекосяк. И призматическая энергия теперь распространяется по всему Радужному острову.",
        "434189991326412800": "Прости, но мне нужно было убедиться, что Виктору можно доверять и что он сможет выяснить то, что не удалось мне. Понимаешь, двери в лабиринт были закрыты для тебя, но не для меня. По крайней мере, до этого момента.",
        "434189991829729280": "Когда я впервые столкнулась с призма-ядром, еще до того, как попала сюда, когда произошла катастрофа... это оставило на мне отпечаток. Я пыталась защититься от взрыва и выжила, но что-то во мне изменилось.",
        "434189992282714112": "Часть энергетической сигнатуры призма-ядра теперь живет во мне. Вот почему я не могу подойти к нему слишком близко и вот почему мне нужна твоя помощь.",
        "434189992735698944": "Пойми, пожалуйста, я просто не могла допустить, чтобы все это повторилось. Если бы я передала ключи от этого места не тому человеку... В общем, просто поверь, что это наш последний шанс.",
        "434189993218043904": "У меня нет пути назад.",
        "434189993696194560": "Если кто-то и может найти его, то это ты, Беатрикс.",
        "434192420939919360": "Мне нравится называть это место Мечтарий. Я часто забиралась сюда и коротала часы среди облаков. Это отличное место, чтобы забыть о своих проблемах.",
        "434192423401975808": "Значит, тут и создается атмосфера лабиринта?",
        "434192423859154944": "Ты мечтаешь о чем-нибудь, Джиджи?",
        "434192424307945472": "Пора мне самой исследовать этот Мечтарий.",
        "434192424760930304": "Думаю, да, и даже больше. Воздух тут какой-то другой. Сложно объяснить. Как будто облака и даже остров под ногами сотканы из эфира вокруг.",
        "434192425192943616": "Не как строение или конструктор, а как скопление из крошечных ничто в воздухе. Я провела много времени на этих островах, и, клянусь, иногда я чувствую своего рода течение. Как будто я обретаю над ним контроль.",
        "434192425650122752": "Однажды я сидела тут и тосковала по дому, вспоминая как в детстве гуляла в мамином саду по вечерам и из дома доносился запах ужина.",
        "434192426132467712": "Я с восторгом смотрела на овощи, растущие прямо передо мной, и вдыхала витающий в воздухе аромат их приготовления. Казалось, что все взаимосвязано.",
        "434192426606424064": "А потом, сидя здесь, я закрыла глаза, пытаясь снова представить себе тот сад, и в тот момент, клянусь, я почуяла запах готовящегося ужина.",
        "434192427101351936": "Когда я открыла глаза, вдали передо мной возник новый остров, а на нем — дом, в котором я выросла. Но он пробыл там всего мгновение, прежде чем исчезнуть в облаках...",
        "434192427579502592": "У меня было много мечтаний. Я хотела освободиться от ожиданий, которые возлагали на меня мои родители. Сама выбирать свой путь. Поэтому я мечтала сбежать и стать тем, кем захочу.",
        "434192428028293120": "Я мечтала, что однажды они увидят, какой я стала, и порадуются за меня. И всё как-нибудь наладится. И не будет иметь значения, что я оставила их.",
        "434192428472889344": "Но в молодости мы не всегда замечаем проблемы, которые буквально у нас перед глазами. Наша версия мира похожа на запотевшее зеркало в ванной. Различаем очертания предметов, но не детали.",
        "434192428925874176": "Теперь я знаю, что моя мама так и не смогла смириться со смертью моей бабушки. Я не осознавала, как на нее давила необходимость сохранить ее наследие и какая необъятная печаль заполнила всю ее жизнь... Пока сама не ушла.",
        "434192429374664704": "Теперь я мечтаю о том, что когда-нибудь я вернусь домой и мои родители поймут, почему мне пришлось уехать. Я думаю, к этому всегда все сводится... ты просто хочешь, чтобы они тебя поняли.",
        "434192429836038144": "Смотри под ноги. Мечтам может прийти конец на раз-два.",
        "434196761864204288": "Привет, Беатрикс. Не похоже, чтобы ты затерялась в грезах.",
        "434196764397563904": "Кажется, здесь все становится золотым...",
        "434196764867325952": "Ты чувствуешь себя потерянной, Джиджи?",
        "434196765337088000": "Да, из-за близости Мечтария и призма-ядра ты можешь наблюдать худшие из его эффектов.",
        "434196765790072832": "Здесь я видела, как вода превращалась в стекло, деревья — в металл, а целые конструкции, окружавшие призма-ядро, становились почти невидимыми, а затем полностью исчезали, как будто выпадая из реальности.",
        "434196766251446272": "Постепенно весь Мечтарий превратится в золото, если мы ничего не сделаем. То, на чем ты стоишь станет тяжелым и обрушится вниз. Потом созданная здесь атмосфера рухнет и еще больше дестабилизирует лабиринт.",
        "434196766717014016": "Как только лабиринт схлопнется, и энергия призма-ядра распространится по всему Далёкому-Далёкому Запределью, этот мир преобразится до неузнаваемости, унося с собой всю жизнь на планете.",
        "434196767195164672": "Слаймы...",
        "434196767660732416": "Да, даже самые живучие слаймы не переживут такую катастрофу. Но мы этого не допустим. Мы что-нибудь придумаем.",
        "434196768130494464": "Я все время чувствую себя такой потерянной. Но, кажется, не настолько, как в Стеклянной пустыне.",
        "434196768587673600": "Ты пересекла Стеклянную пустыню?",
        "434196769053241344": "Да, дважды, если можешь в это поверить. И, по правде говоря, это меня чуть не убило...",
        "434196769531392000": "Видишь ли, когда я начала исследовать Стеклянную пустыню, я обнаружила, что это название совсем не подходит для такого места. Все вокруг было зеленым и изобилующим жизнью.",
        "434196769996959744": "Дело в том, что там течет совершенно особенная вода, которая может волшебным образом расти... ну, кому, собственно, я это рассказываю.",
        "434196770475110400": "И поэтому я недостаточно хорошо подготовилась. А на обратном пути... Стеклянная пустыня оправдала свою репутацию.",
        "434196770932289536": "Бесплодная пустошь. Ветер жалил мое лицо и ослеплял меня. И каждый раз, когда мне казалось, что я нашла верное направление, мир вокруг меня вспыхивал пламенем.",
        "434196771376885760": "Как ты находила в себе силы продолжать?",
        "434196771855036416": "Джиджи на мгновение замерла и провела пальцами по лохмотьям своего плаща.",
        "434196772320604160": "Этот плащ принадлежал моей бабушке. Изначально это было одеяло, которым она укутывала ноги. Я видела его на фотографиях. Потом он перешел к моей матери, а затем она подарила его мне.",
        "434196772781977600": "Мама всегда зашивала каждую прореху или потертость, как только они появлялись. Так много мелких стежков, которые не совсем совпадали, но она старалась, чтобы все было в порядке.",
        "434196773243351040": "Однажды я сидела на полу пещеры, слушая, как снаружи бушует буря. Я завернулась в свой плащ и просто плакала под тяжестью всего происходящего. Я была измотана, и все казалось невыносимым.",
        "434196773717307392": "И тогда я почувствовала, что мама меня защищает. Я посмотрела на все эти зигзагообразные стежки, обернутые вокруг меня, и поняла, что она не давала ему развалиться ради меня, во что бы то ни стало.",
        "434196774170292224": "И пускай теперь оно порвано и потерто и уже никогда не будет прежним, оно до сих пор со мной. Оно спасло меня, так же как мы спасем это место, которое, возможно, тоже никогда не будет прежним, но мы не дадим ему развалиться, Беатрикс.",
        "434196774627471360": "Не останавливайся, Беатрикс.",
        "434198584142491648": "Я с трудом могу поверить, что ты зашла так далеко, Беатрикс. Этот лабиринт поглотил бы обычного человека. Но ты не такая. Я была права, когда поверила в тебя.",
        "434198586608742400": "Впереди призма-ядро. Возможно, вместе у нас есть шанс остановить его и изменить будущее Далёкого-Далёкого Запределья…",
        "434198587065921536": "Развязка нашей истории ждет вас в следующем обновлении контента! А пока исследуйте лабиринт, общайтесь с Джиджи и создавайте инфраструктуру с помощью гаджетов, которые помогут вам в путешествиях.",

        "434198588886249472": "Я очень, очень люблю слаймов.",

        "434627962089402368": "Я видела, как вода превращается в стекло. Цветы — в металл. Это ужасно.",
        "434627965256101888": "И тут ее выражение лица снова меняется. Она все еще улыбается, но я вижу, как в уголках ее глаз начинают собираться слезы, которые она сдерживает.",
        "434629957986709504": "Детекторы работают даже на твоей карте. Обязательно размести их побольше и покрой как можно большую часть лабиринта. Если хочешь собрать много призма-плортов, это важно. Они нам понадобятся, когда ты меня найдешь.",

        "434637451849003008": "Если так подумать, я прибыла сюда как раз вовремя. Пожалуй, вовремя и в то же время совершенно не вовремя..",
        "434638300511891456": "Я до сих пор не знаю, было ли это на самом деле.",
        "434639513852735488": "Я провела много дней, прячась в пещерах и пытаясь найти мужество двигаться дальше. Но я знала, что должна вернуться на Радужный остров и найти решение.",
        "442195192629063680": "И потом она говорит, как ей жаль, что бабушка не успела познакомиться со мной.",
        "442195194155790336": "Затем кладет руку мне на плечо и хочет сказать что-то еще, но звонит коммуникатор, и она отворачивается.",
        "442195194625552384": "Это последнее, что я помню.",
        "428361726019923968": "Беатрикс! Я получил новое сообщение от ИИ, с которым общаюсь после твоего прибытия на Радужный остров.",
        "428361726045089792": "Оно довольно личное, но может содержать важные сведения и для тебя. Чтобы помочь тебе, я зачитаю его полностью...",
        "428361726045089793": "Кхм! ",
        "428361726045089794": "«Виктор! Спасибо, что общаешься со мной: за это множество дней мы хорошо узнали друг друга. Я хочу признаться, что мне пришлось начать наше общение с целью оценки твоих исследовательских способностей.",
        "428361726045089795": "Наша переписка не только продемонстрировала их, но и неожиданно принесла ощущение спокойствия и поддержки в непростые для меня времена.",
        "428361726045089796": "Высылаю тебе незаконченный чертеж одного своего устройства — у меня не получается его завершить. Если это получится у тебя, то оно должно открыть Серый лабиринт. ",
        "428361726045089797": "Пойми меня, Виктор. У меня не было задачи тебя обмануть. Просто мне нужно было знать, что я могу на тебя положиться. Только так у нас будет шанс все наладить. Если это все-таки случится, мне хотелось бы увидеться с тобой.",
        "428361726045089798": "Было бы здорово снова поиграть в го за кофе до самого рассвета».",
        "428361726045089799": "Вот и все сообщение.",
        "428361726045089800": "В моих руках оказался сложный чертеж незаконченного устройства с, признаюсь, едва ли понятным кодом. Я анализировал устройство несколько дней и, кажется, доработал его так, чтобы оно выполняло свою задачу.",
        "428361726045089801": "По крайней мере, я на это надеюсь. Честно говоря, мне бы не хотелось подвести ИИ. Я чувствую, что должен помочь, потому что... мы стали с ним друзьями.",
        "428361726045089802": "Так что передаю тебе готовый чертеж со всеми инструкциями. Судя по всему, это устройство нужно использовать у входов в лабиринт. Боюсь, больше мне ничего не известно.",
        "428361726045089803": "Если засомневаешься, как его использовать — экспериментируй! Только так можно узнать неизвестное.",
        "428361726045089804": "Удачи, Беатрикс! Мы на тебя рассчитываем.",
        "497217680223924224": "Привет ещё раз! Я связала эту станцию обмена со своей лабораторией, так что теперь ты можешь отправлять мне находки, а я тебе — свои поделки.",
        "497217686565711872": "А может быть, и гармонизаторы…",
        "494426433331556352": "Очень надеюсь. Думаю, всё нестабильное или чужеродное здесь — из-за призматических волн, окутывающих лабиринт и искажающих материю. Если придумать способ нейтрализовать их хотя бы локально — возможно, этого хватит, чтобы обнаружить гармонизаторы.\n",
        "494426435990745088": "А такое вообще можно создать?",
        "494426436984795136": "Итак, для начала работы над чертежом мне понадобятся призма-плорты. Придется провести не один опыт с призмами, чтобы понять, как все работает.",
        "503065643299008514": "А что касается самого изготовления... возможно, ответ — в тех странных сумрачных слаймах, которых ты видела в лабиринте. Их плорты естественно глушат призматические волны. Может, они как-то эволюционировали, чтобы делать это? Они могут выравнивать длины волн, чтобы...",
        "503065643299008515": "Прости, увлеклась. Просто не проходи мимо сумрачных плортов — возможно, они ещё пригодятся. А пока принеси мне призма-плорты, и я займусь нейтрализатором.",
        "494426436498255872": "Принято.",
        "503065643299008518": "Мы все ближе, Беатрикс. Доведём дело до конца.",
        "512531865044414464": "Если тебе удастся добыть эти плорты, я смогу завершить чертёж нейтрализатора. Шансов мало, но надежда — это всё, что у нас есть, Беатрикс.",
        "512855595578716160": "Теперь у тебя есть чертёж нейтрализатора и ты можешь создать его на изготовителе в оранжерее. А дальше — всё в твоих руках: ищи скрытые участки за странными стенами.",
        "512528636512464896": "Продолжай искать странные стены. Если использовать перед ними нейтрализатор, у тебя должно получиться пройти через них. Надеюсь, ты найдешь там гармонизаторы, и мы попробуем стабилизировать призма-ядро.",
        "515408179648688128": "Запись: «Ты активировала все гармонизаторы! Подойди ко мне, я у призма-ядра. Теперь начинается настоящая работа…»",
        "515407435033899008": "Запись: «Привет, Беатрикс! Я перевела станцию обмена в автоматический режим. Можешь сдавать призма-плорты в любое время и получать радужные монеты. Не благодари!»",
        "459162059549601792": "Привет, Беатрикс. Похоже, ты активировала не все гармонизаторы.\n",
        "512135795118338048": "Используй нейтрализатор, чтобы обнаруживать скрытые пути в лабиринте. Ищи стены, которые выглядят… странно. Как будто их исказили призматические волны.",
        "512137435087007744": "Потрясающе! Ты активировала все гармонизаторы — мы почти готовы начать стабилизацию призма-ядра.",
        "512137648556109824": "Чтобы всё сработало, нам понадобится много воды. Но у тебя, похоже, нет водного бака. Попробуй создать его на изготовителе в оранжерее, а потом возвращайся и дай мне знать, как будешь готова.",
        "508172740122537984": "Я смастерила гидродуш для экстренных случаев, но воды тут нет — одни трубы. Если удастся как-то запустить подачу воды, он точно пригодится… поверь.",
        "508173982047563776": "Подробности расскажу позже.\n",
        "459162940231806976": "За дело!",
        "459163070364282880": "Мне нужно ещё немного подготовиться.",
        "459163407372414976": "Возвращайся, как будешь готова. Я буду ждать.",
        "459163883820183552": "Как всегда, вся надежда на тебя, Беатрикс.\n",
        "512137991872475136": "Вот он, момент истины, Беатрикс. Гармонизаторы активированы, и теперь с твоей помощью я могу стабилизировать призма-ядро.",
        "512152448220688384": "Беатрикс! Все показатели призма-ядра… стабильны! Оно теперь совсем на другой частоте! Я… я чувствую это.",
        "512404458169856000": "Вот оно, Беатрикс… призма-ядро.\n",
        "512404595482980352": "Когда я увидела его впервые — у меня перехватило дыхание. Этот свет внутри и то, как он крутился, двигался, менялся каждую секунду… Это было как заглянуть в бесконечность. Если бы я только знала, чем это обернётся для меня... для всего вокруг.",
        "512405717933256704": "Прости, что притащила тебя сюда и втянула во все это. Но по-другому было нельзя.\r",
        "512520617573642240": "Как я и говорила, кажется, я смогу придумать способ распознавать скрытые участки в лабиринте.",
        "512775262921453568": "Лишь со временем полностью оправится земля и исчезнут все эти призматические разрывы. Но Радужный остров... нет, всё будущее Далёкого-Далёкого Запределья спасено. Ты справилась, Беатрикс. Мы справились. Я не знаю, как тебя благодарить.",
        "522633243620175872": "Слава богу, ты вернулась. Я успела остановить процесс и расчистить всё как раз вовремя. Как всё-таки хорошо, что я установила аварийный душ!",
        "523379801986854912": "Привет, Беатрикс. Я зову это место террариумом.",
        "523379806806110208": "Почему «террариумом»?",
        "523379807615610880": "Это место… для чего оно? Для хранения?",
        "523379808395751424": "Пойду осмотрюсь прямо сейчас.",
        "523379809226223616": "Ну… террариум — это просто помещение, где растения живут вне своей природной среды.",
        "523379810023141376": "Когда я попала сюда впервые, я увидела это именно так. Биосфера. Очень красивая, с редкой едой и слаймами.",
        "523379810853613568": "И… может, так и есть. Возможно, всё это — просто способ воссоздать внешний мир внутри лабиринта, под надёжным стеклом.",
        "523379811671502848": "Но… теперь я уже не уверена.",
        "523379812455837696": "Так что же это на самом деле?",
        "523379813261144064": "Мне нужно двигаться дальше.",
        "523379814079033344": "В том и дело, Беатрикс. Я правда не знаю. Но…",
        "523379814884339712": "Я почти уверена, что весь лабиринт — это комплекс, созданный для сдерживания и стабилизации призма-ядра. Так что логично предположить, что и террариум связан с ним.",
        "523379815681257472": "И если задуматься, чем это место могло быть...",
        "523379816478175232": "Может, это что-то вроде банка семян. Знаешь, на случай, если всё пойдёт совсем плохо, если призма-ядро станет нестабильным и выйдет из-под контроля… Это могло бы спасти хоть какую-то часть флоры от катастрофы.",
        "523379817296064512": "Если так, то террариум — это, по сути, страховка. Чтобы, если случится страшное, можно было хоть с чего-то начать по новой.",
        "523379818080399360": "Что ж, могу понять.",
        "523379818885705728": "Что именно?",
        "523379819695206400": "Я постараюсь не довести до такого.",
        "523379820555038720": "Ну, это...",
        "523379821393899520": "...",
        "523379822186622976": "К-конечно, я надеюсь, что мои усилия помогут спасти будущее. Думаю, в этом нет ничего странного — просто хочется оставить после себя что-то хорошее, даже если не знаешь, будет ли в этом толк.",
        "523379823033872384": "Но...",
        "523379823839178752": "Если взглянуть под другим углом: для будущих поколений наш сегодняшний день уже станет прошлым. И хочется верить, что, оглядываясь назад, они увидят — наши действия сделали их мир лучше.",
        "523379824648679424": "Или так: нам хочется всё сделать так, чтобы им там вообще не пришлось ни о чем волноваться.",
        "523379825487540224": "То, что мы делаем здесь, в конечном счёте всё изменит к лучшему. Я должна в это верить.",
        "523379826301235200": "Всё, что мы можем, — жить настоящим. Я продолжу свой путь.",
        "523379827114930176": "Ситуация тяжёлая, но... здесь так много красоты и тепла. Надеюсь, ты тоже найдёшь минутку, чтобы этим насладиться.",
        "523380586816630784": "Привет, Беатрикс. Удивительное местечко, правда?",
        "523380587600965632": "Похоже на какой-нибудь музей!",
        "523380588435632128": "Некогда задерживаться, Джиджи.",
        "523380589240938496": "Наверное, это из-за стеклянных витрин... но, по-моему, у них совсем другое предназначение. Я думаю, они как-то связаны с управлением временем.",
        "523380590050439168": "Я некоторое время наблюдала за теми, что с растениями, и заметила, что внутри них время течёт быстрее, чем снаружи.",
        "523380590868328448": "Полагаю, это способ изучать влияние призма-ядра на природу. Возможно, они помогают предсказать, что случится, если произойдёт прорыв ядра.",
        "523380591715577856": "А с миниатюрными зданиями тоже что-то происходит?",
        "523380592537661440": "Некогда задерживаться.",
        "523380593342967808": "Возможно, но я не уверена.",
        "523380594135691264": "Может, происходит. А может, здесь уже управление не временем, а пространством... или чем-то третьим — настолько чуждым, что мы просто никогда не поймём, что это.",
        "523380594928414720": "На Радужном острове столько загадок, Беатрикс. Думаю, что за всю жизнь мы и половины не разгадаем.",
        "523380595721138176": "Иногда остаётся только смотреть сквозь стекло и гадать, что же происходит по ту сторону.",
        "523380596513861632": "Ты часто так себя чувствуешь?",
        "523380597340139520": "Честно говоря, я уже давно так себя чувствую.",
        "523380598174806016": "Вся моя жизнь была распланирована: я должна была вырасти и унаследовать ранчо — так же, как мама унаследовала его от бабушки. А потом передать его своему ребёнку. Всё это задумывалось с такой любовью. Красивый дом, семейное дело...",
        "523380598980112384": "Мой мир был совсем маленьким. Словно я — под стеклянным куполом, прижимаюсь к нему ладонями и мечтаю о жизни, которая могла бы быть, родись я где-нибудь ещё, а не на ранчо.",
        "523380599785418752": "Я пришла на Радужный остров, чтобы попробовать прожить ту самую другую жизнь. А теперь я снова в ловушке — только теперь по-настоящему. Иронично, правда? Заперта за стеклом, как всё здесь.",
        "523380600670416896": "Я продолжу путь и помогу тебе выбраться так скоро, как смогу.",
        "523380601471528960": "Знаю, что время поджимает… но постарайся хоть немного насладиться тем, что вокруг.",
        "523382731968245760": "О нет... золото. Значит, и террариум начал искажаться. Хотя, может, здесь всё ещё можно срезать.",
        "523382733075542016": "Золото — это плохо, да?",
        "523382733901819904": "Здесь можно срезать?",
        "523382734740680704": "Пора двигаться дальше.",
        "523382735625678848": "Всё, что оказывается рядом с призма-ядром, может исказиться под его влиянием: материя меняется — одно вещество превращается в другое, твёрдое становится жидким или газом, а то и вовсе исчезает...",
        "523382736426790912": "За пределами лабиринта эти изменения почти безвредны, но здесь они весьма опасны. Представь, что участок пола под тобой просто исчезнет... или что единственная дверь обернётся каменной стеной.",
        "523382737257263104": "А золото... это, похоже, самая мощная форма превращения. И, возможно, именно в него превратится весь наш мир, если не остановить процесс.",
        "523382738058375168": "Всё это напоминает мне историю про царя Мидаса.",
        "523382738859487232": "Царя Мидаса?",
        "523382739689959424": "Это древняя легенда. Царь Мидас пожелал, чтобы всё, к чему он прикасался, превращалось в золото. Он стал богаче всех, но вскоре понял, что не может ни есть, ни пить — и угас.",
        "523382740512043008": "Когда я впервые обнаружила призма-ядро, меня ужаснуло, что вся экосистема превращается в золото. Я звала на помощь, но пришедшие увидели не опасность, а наживу.",
        "523382741329932288": "Всё обернулось катастрофой, когда они попытались подчинить себе силу призма-ядра. Я не допущу повторения истории. Мы не допустим.",
        "523382742143627264": "Значит, мне лучше поторопиться и попробовать срезать?",
        "523382742982488064": "Да, кажется, там был проход. Хотя на свою память сейчас не особо полагаюсь.",
        "523382743829737472": "Забавно, но кратчайшие тропы бывают не только в пространстве, но и во времени. Эти проекторы, например, я настраивала, опираясь на воспоминания и квантовые технологии — по сути, срез через время.",
        "523382744668598272": "Физические тропы, пожалуй, проще понять. Когда знаешь, как быстро вернуться туда, где уже бывал… это может повлиять на твои решения. Со мной так и вышло.",
        "523382745478098944": "Хотя, в конце концов, мы всё равно часто оказываемся в одной и той же точке. Так или иначе.",
        "523382746308571136": "До скорого, Беатрикс.",
        "523383596829536256": "Беатрикс, посмотри в окно. Там так много всего… куда больше, чем я себе представляла.",
        "523383597957804032": "Разве ты раньше там не была?",
        "523383598784081920": "А почему ты поставила проектор именно здесь?",
        "523383599606165504": "Завораживает… но пора двигаться дальше.",
        "523383600424054784": "Нет, не была. Не припоминаю, чтобы видела что-либо за этими окнами. Я увидела всё это только теперь — когда ты включила проектор.",
        "523383601229361152": "Знаешь, тогда мне казалось, что я обошла весь комплекс. Я была уверена, что хорошо тут ориентируюсь.",
        "523383602017890304": "В такие моменты я будто впервые замечаю, насколько огромен лабиринт. Он уходит за горизонт… Неужели он всегда был здесь, а я просто не замечала?",
        "523383602810613760": "Хотя, может, его и не было. Вдруг он создан с помощью квантовой архитектуры? Это значит, он может возникнуть из ниоткуда — и так же внезапно исчезнуть. Или даже существовать и не существовать одновременно.",
        "523383603599142912": "Я ведь и сама часто пользуюсь квантовыми технологиями. Было бы глупо не допустить такую возможность.",
        "523383604450586624": "А как ты используешь квантовые технологии?",
        "523383605264281600": "Пойду-ка я дальше, пока и это место тоже не исчезло.",
        "523383606057005056": "О, по-разному. Ты прямо сейчас с одной из них взаимодействуешь.",
        "523383606879088640": "Сами по себе проекторы не квантовые, но то, как я их расставила — да. Ты ведь по пути сюда открыла множество запертых проходов, да? Но не то что бы я туда пробиралась, ставила свои штуки и потом запирала всё за собой.",
        "523383607663423488": "Когда я впервые сюда пришла, всё было открыто. Я гуляла где хотела. А потом с помощью квантовых технологий разместила проекторы в местах, которые помню, что видела своими глазами.",
        "523383608443564032": "Правда… память у меня уже не та, так что некоторые проекторы могли и потеряться по ходу дела. Ну, узнаем — когда (или если) ты до них доберёшься.",
        "523383609236287488": "И что ты вспоминала, когда ставила этот?",
        "523383610091925504": "Тогда пойду искать остальные.",
        "523383610918203392": "Этот я поставила, потому что вспомнила одно прелестное деревце. Воспоминание вспыхнуло так неожиданно…",
        "523383611719315456": "Был на нашем ранчо один мяуровый слайм. Дикий, но часто к нам заглядывал. Но всегда в одно и то же время, в районе обеда, он прыгал туда, откуда пришел.",
        "523383612520427520": "И вот однажды… я решила за ним проследить.",
        "523383613338316800": "Он завёл меня далеко в лес. В какой-то момент он задорно вильнул хвостиком у огромного дерева и начал забираться вверх, как мячик, прыгая с ветки на ветку.",
        "523383614231703552": "Я полезла следом. Где-то на полпути я потеряла его из виду, но всё равно продолжала взбираться. Вскоре я выбралась из-под кроны, и… о, Беатрикс, даже не знаю, как это описать.",

        "523383615863287808": "У меня перехватило дыхание. Просидела там несколько часов, пока мама меня не хватилась. Ох и влетело же мне тогда!",

        "527357008383995904": "Увы, пока я не могу отблагодарить тебя лично — как бы мне этого ни хотелось. Я заперлась в комплексе за этой комнатой. Ты заслужила объяснение. После всего, что ты сделала, я просто не могу оставить тебя без ответов.",

Ядро очень быстро теряло стабильность, а когда я попыталась это исправить — только усугубила ситуацию. Я обратилась не к тем людям, и они попытались использовать его силу в корыстных целях. ",
        "527360055189336064": "Потом всё стремительно покатилось в бездну. Случился взрыв. Призматический свет прошёл сквозь Радужный остров и достиг атмосферы Далёкого-Далёкого Запределья. Я успела защититься от взрыва, но моя рука… с ней что-то случилось.",
        "527360305023053824": "Энергия призма-ядра словно отпечаталась во мне. Я чувствую, как она пульсирует в руке, несмотря на все попытки сдержать её. Именно поэтому я изолировала себя и обратилась к тебе: стоит мне приблизиться к призма-ядру — и дестабилизация ускоряется, как будто оно чувствует своё собственное отражение.",

        "527361539041816576": "Мой дом — Далёкое-Далёкое Запределье в моём времени… он на грани катастрофы. Энергия призма-ядра окутала атмосферу, искажая окружающую среду, как здесь: деревья превращаются в металл, вода — в стекло, и даже сама природа начинает исчезать из реальности.",
        "527361573745487872": "Со временем просто не останется ничего, что могло бы поддерживать жизнь. И, осознавая, что я приложила к этому руку… я не могла остаться в стороне. ",

        "527365580824145920": "Да. Возможно, портал можно починить… но, как и многое здесь, это за пределами моего понимания. Я должна смириться с тем, что больше не вернусь домой. Никогда не увижу семью.",
        "527365598020792320": "Но если нам удастся стабилизировать призма-ядро — оно того стоит. Мы спасём не только этот мир, но и исправим ошибки в будущем. Я должна в это верить.",

        "527367021353660416": "Потом объясню. Но, кажется, у меня есть то, чего не было у них… и это может повлиять на то, как всё сложится сейчас.",
        "527367034532163584": "Только вот проблема: гармонизаторы утеряны. Нет ни одного упоминания о том, где они могут быть. Да что там, мы даже не знаем как они выглядели. Я буквально ничего не знаю. И не представляю, с чего начать.",

        "527650273687662592": "Я хочу просто сидеть в тишине и смотреть, как облака медленно плывут по небу. Навестить друзей. Просидеть за игрой в го до самой ночи. ",

        "528374290384056320": "Когда ты будешь готова, я начну накладывать волны гармонизаторов на призма-ядро. Это вызовет сильные искажения и приведёт его в состояние хаоса — до тех пор, пока мы не сможем его стабилизировать.\n",

        "528374369555738624": "Твоя задача — расправиться с варрами, пока они не дестабилизировали призма-ядро и не погубили нас. Вода здесь долго не задерживается — рядом с ядром она быстро превращается в стекло.",

        "528377335033524224": "Всё схвачено! Я установила гидродуш над призма-ядром. Ему просто нужно набрать достаточно давления. А для этого — наполни его слаймами! Так мы спасём не только ситуацию, но и слаймов.\n",
        "528378858748669952": "К тому же я сохраню содержимое твоего вакотсека на время операции, чтобы у тебя было больше места для слаймов.\n",

        "528428360129998848": "Поживём — увидим. Но думаю, оно сможет стать частью мира, который мы теперь называем домом. Людей ведь тоже здесь не было, пока однажды они сюда не приземлились. А теперь посмотри на нас — нам удалось гармонично вписаться и даже не разрушить всё вокруг. Так и должно быть.",
        "528428517668057088": "Призма-ядро тоже когда-то блуждало в пустоте космоса, пока не упало сюда. И теперь оно часть этого мира. Ему просто нужно найти своё место… как и мне.",

        "108799766553817132": "Hallo Beatrix. Ich wollte dir meine Dankbarkeit ausdrücken für die Hilfe, die ich von dir erhalten habe, seit ich dich kennen gelernt habe. Mit deiner Unterstützung habe ich mich als Person verbessert, glaube ich.",
        "108799766553817133": "Meine Nachforschungen ergaben, dass ein Geschenk oder eine Kleinigkeit angemessen wären. Also, bitte, nimm dies an.",
        "108799766553817134": "Ah, Beatrix. Ich habe das Labor aufgeräumt und das hier gefunden. Vielleicht hast du Verwendung dafür? Ich glaube, es funktionert noch.",
        "108799766553817135": "Wie man so sagt: Des einen Müll ist des anderen hastig überreichtes Geschenk. Viel Spaß damit!",
        "108799766553817136": "Oh hallo. Ich muss dir sagen, ich habe das hier gesehen, und es schrie förmlich \"Beatrix!\"",
        "108799766553817137": "... und so habe ich gemerkt, dass ich es versehentlich mit dem Empfindungsstrahl getroffen habe. Aber keine Sorge, jetzt ist alles in Ordnung und äusserst normal.",
        "108799766553817138": "Jedenfalls dachte ich, du solltest es haben. Viel Spaß damit!",
        "108799766553817139": "Sorry Beatrix, ich stecke gerade mitten in so einer Sache. Um genau zu sein, in einem Streit zwischen einem Toaster und meiner Waschmaschine.",
        "108799766553817140": "Ich führe wieder Robotik-Experimente durch. Es läuft echt gut!",
        "108799766553817141": "Tut mir leid, Beatrix, aber ich kann mich gerade nicht mit Konversation, Geplauder, Debatte oder auch Smalltalk befassen.",
        "108799766553817142": "Vielleicht ein andermal?",
        "108799766553817143": "Hallo Beatrix! Trotz gegenteiligen Anscheins ist hier nicht Viktor, sondern ein Hologramm von Viktor, das Viktor entwickelt hat, um Nachrichten für Viktor zu empfangen, der ich nicht bin.",
        "108799766553817144": "Bitte hinterlasse eine Nachricht und ich werde sicherstellen, dass sie nicht mich, sondern Viktor erreicht.",
        "108799766553817145": "Na da schau her. Beatrix LeBeau unterwegs zu einem neuen Abenteuer und kein Gedanke daran, ihre gute Freundin, manchmal Rivalin und für immer Mentorin, Mochi Miles mitzunehmen?",
        "108799766553817146": "Ernsthaft Bea, wenn du nächstes Mal in gefährliches unbekanntes Terrain rennst, könntest du es mich wenigstens wissen lassen?",
        "108799766553817147": "Ich wäre gerne da für dich, falls du mich brauchst...",
        "108799766553817148": "... um zu helfen, all die wertvollen Ressourcen zu sammeln, die anscheinend überall auf der Insel verteilt sind.",
        "108799766553817149": "Was? Denkst du, ich wäre nicht selbst auf Erkundungstour gegangen? Wozu sind Überwachungssatelliten gut, wenn sie nicht rumschnüffeln können?",
        "108799766553817150": "...",
        "108799766553817151": "Sei jedenfalls vorsichtig da draußen. Die Insel kommt mir irgendwie seltsam vor. Also werde ich weiter herumstochern.",
        "108799766553817152": "Oh, und da ich weiß, dass du bei Null anfängst da draußen, nimm diese Raffinerieverbindung. Sollte dir die Dinge erleichtern. Ich schreibs dir einfach auf deinen Deckel. Bis später.",
        "108799766553817153": "Hey Bea, diese Drohnen, die du überall auf der Insel findest... an denen ist etwas seltsam.",
        "108799766553817154": "Hm?",
        "108799766553817155": "Hey, ich habe Augen am Himmel und ich werde sie benutzen. Ich bereite auch ein Team von Drohnen vor, um es rüber zu schicken und die Dinge etwas direkter zu untersuchen, aber ich schweife ab...",
        "108799766553817156": "Jedenfalls scheint die Drohne super-fortgeschritten, fast außerirdisch. Also dachte ich, ok, da checken ein paar Aliens die Regenbogeninsel ab, genau wie du. Aber nein, das glaube ich nicht.",
        "108799766553817157": "Denn sie sieht den Drohnen, die wir benutzen, sehr ähnlich... nur so viel vertrauter für mich. Fast ein Deja Vu. Irgendwie unheimlich!",
        "108799766553817158": "Hey, keine Angst. Sind vermutlich bloss Aliens. Riesige dreiköpfige Aliens mit gigantischen Klauen, die nach Menschen suchen, um sie zu fangen oder zu fressen oder BEIDES.",
        "108799766553817159": "Hahahahaha!",
        "108799766553817160": "Bis später, Bea.",
        "108799766553817161": "Bea! Ich habe versucht, dich zu erreichen. Ich habe eine der Drohnen untersucht, die du überall auf der Insel findest, und weiss, warum sie mir so bekannt vorkommt. Es ist meine.",
        "108799766553817162": "Oder zumindest ist es eine, die ich schon mal gesehen habe... wenigstens in meinen Träumen.",
        "108799766553817163": "Nachdem ich mir die Scans angeschaut habe, die ich gemacht habe, wusste ich, dass sie mir bekannt ist, also habe ich ein paar alte Slimewissenschafts-Journale von mir durchgeblättert. Diese Journale sind hauptsächlich zukünftige Projekte, aber manchmal auch spekulative Technologie.",
        "108799766553817164": "Du kennst mich, ich denke immer sechs Schritte voraus, um Mochi Tech an der Spitze der Industrie zu halten. Tja, manchmal kommt mir Unmögliches in den Sinn, Zeug, das ich nie im Leben entwickeln werde.",
        "108799766553817165": "Und die Drohnen, die du gerade findest, sind genau das: Unmöglich mit heutiger Technologie und direkt aus den Seiten meiner Aufzeichnungen. Sie sind etwas, das ich im Traum gesehen habe, Bea!",
        "108799766553817166": "Also wie kommt ein Haufen unmöglicher Drohnen, die ich in einem Traum entworfen habe, von den Seiten meiner Aufzeichnungen auf die Regenbogeninsel?",
        "108799766553817167": "...",
        "108799766553817168": "Vielleicht ... vielleicht gibt es in ihnen eine Art von Archiv, das wir öffnen und aus dem wir mehr erfahren können. Ich weiss, dass sie Datenlogs enthalten, aber wenn ich es wäre... nun, ich finde immer einen Weg, das zurückzuhalten, was ich muss...",
        "108799766553817169": "Okay Bea, ich brauche etwas Zeit, um darüber nachzudenken. Ich sag dir Bescheid, wenn mir etwas einfällt. Vielleicht schlafe ich erst mal drüber …",
        "108799766553817170": "Hey Bea, ich habe hier was, was du ausprobieren solltest. und ehrlich gesagt, wenn es funktioniert, werde ich das richtig gruslig finden.",
        "108799766553817171": "Ich habe die Blaupause eines Schlüssels angefertigt: Einen speziellen Archivschlüssel für die Drohnen, die du gefunden hast. Wenn irgendwelche Archivdaten in ihnen existieren, sollte man so auf sie zugreifen können.",
        "108799766553817172": "Ich sage \"sollte\", denn tatsächlich habe ich keine Ahnung. Aber wenn das die Drohnen von den Seiten meiner Aufzeichnungen sind, dann wäre dieser Schlüssel der Weg, auf ihre Archive zuzugreifen, wenn ich je etwas wie sie gebaut hätte.",
        "108799766553817173": "Ich weiss, das ergibt kaum Sinn, aber du musst es versuchen. Wenn es funktioniert und ein Archiv existiert und es dir irgendwie erlaubt, besser zu verstehen, was auf dieser Insel vorgeht...",
        "108799766558011392": "...na, ich bin froh, dass ich dir helfen konnte. Ich schulde dir irgendwie immer noch was, stimmt's?",
        "108799766558011393": "Argh, das habe ich gerade nicht gesagt! Stelle einfach den blöden Schlüssel her und sag mir noch nicht, ob es funktioniert oder nicht.",
        "108799766558011394": "Denn falls es das tut, glaube ich wirklich, ich bin noch nicht bereit dafür, mit diesem Wissen umzugehen.",
        "108799766558011395": "Bis später. Und viel Glück.",
        "108799766558011396": "Hey Bea, ich habe was gefunden, was ich wegwerfen wollte, aber dann dachte ich mir, hey, Bea mag alten Krempel, den ich nicht brauche. Ich wette, sie wird's mögen.",
        "108799766558011397": "Du kannst mir später danken.",
        "108799766558011398": "Hallooooo Beatrix! Rate mal, wer die glücklichste Person in der Galaxis ist?",
        "108799766558011399": "DU BIST ES! Weil du ein Geschenk von DER Mochi Miles bekommst!",
        "108799766558011400": "Ich lasse das erst mal sacken. Du kannst dich setzen, wenn du musst.",
        "108799766558011401": "Hey Bea, hast du nicht neulich gesagt, du willst mehr Zeug?",
        "108799766558011402": "Hmmmm... Moment, ich glaube, das war ich.",
        "108799766558011403": "Wie auch immer, viel Spaß mit dem Zeug.",
        "108799766558011404": "Hey Bea, ich habe ein Geschenk für dich, weil, keine Ahnung. Jedenfalls hoffe ich, du magst es.",
        "108799766558011405": "Oder nicht... wieauchimmer.",
        "108799766558011406": "Yo Bea, ich hab hier eine Kleinigkeit für dich. Betonung auf klein.",
        "108799766558011407": "Denn ich habe mir was GROßES besorgt. Viel toller.",
        "108799766558011408": "Sorry Bea, kann nicht plaudern, super busy mit wirklich wichtigem Zeug.",
        "108799766558011409": "Jedenfalls viel wichtiger als was auch immer du willst, sorry. Ich habe keine Zeit, mir anzuhören, wie es dir geht.",
        "108799766558011410": "Aber gut, richtig?",
        "108799766558011411": "Sorry Bea, ich bin spät dran für ein Meeting und übrigens, wie sitzt mein Haar, war nur Spaß. Es ist immer perfekt, muss los also byyyyyeeee!",
        "108799766558011412": "Oh, du wirst es bereuen, jemals Mochi Miles begegnet zu sein. Warte nur ab, bis …",
        "108799766558011413": "Oh, Bea! Sorry, ich dachte, das wäre die andere Leitung. Ich, äh, regle nur ein paar Dinge mit einem Mitbewerber. Nur ein freundliches Gespräch.",
        "108799766558011414": "Hola, Beatrix! Bist du da? Ich bin's, Ogden Ortiz!",
        "108799766558011415": "Ich hab gehört, du bist zu einem neuen Abenteuer auf einer rätselhaften Insel aufgebrochen, voll mit Geheimnissen und Gefahren und vielleicht ein paar saftigen Früchten oder Gemüse, die die Welt nie zuvor gesehen hat...?",
        "108799766558011416": "Du wusstest, dass ich fragen muss! Seit du mir einen stetigen Nachschub an Kookadoba-Früchten besorgt hast, suche ich nach noch größeren kulinarischen Wundern in der Fernen, Fernen Weite!",
        "108799766558011417": "... und außerdem hängt es mir langsam zum Halse raus. Kookadoba-Kuchen, Kookadoba-Soufflee, Kookadoba-Pudding, Kookadoba con Carne, Kookadoba con Kookadoba...",
        "108799766558011418": "Mir gehen die Ideen aus... und der Willen.",
        "108799766558011419": "Also wenn du etwas Neues siehst, erzähl mir alles darüber. Abgesehen von Leckereien will ich alles über die neue Flora und Fauna wissen, die du entdeckst.",
        "108799766558011420": "Nie vergessen: Jeder noch so kleine Teil dieser wilden Welt ist wertvoll und unserer Sorgfalt und unseres Respekts würdig.",
        "108799766558011421": "Und trink genug! All die Abenteurerei bringt dich ins Schwitzen, also nimm diesen Wasserhahn.",
        "108799766558011422": "Viel Glück, Beatrix. Halt mich auf dem Laufenden. Ich drücke dir die Daumen!",
        "108799766558011423": "Beatrix! Ich bin froh, dass du anrufst.",
        "108799766558011424": "Ich habe mir die Bilder angeschaut, die du mir von der Regenbogeninsel geschickt hast. Ohne Zweifel ein ganz besonderer Anblick! Schön, mit Farben, die nur satter werden, je länger man schaut...",
        "108799766558011425": "... aber auch unnatürlich. Tut mir leid, aber irgendwas stimmt an dem Ort nicht.",
        "108799766558011426": "Wie du dich vielleicht erinnerst, war ich einst der Chef eines sehr erfolgreichen Instantnahrungs-Konzerns. Genetisch veränderte Nahrung war unsere Spezialität.",
        "108799766558011427": "Ich bin nicht stolz darauf, wie weit wir gegangen sind, um natürliche Nahrung größer, schneller und billiger wachsen zu lassen: dem Profit zuliebe die guten Bestandteile entfernen.",
        "108799766558011428": "Ich sagte das, Beatrix, weil ich immer noch erkenne, wenn eine Pflanze unnatürlich verändert wurde, wenn ich eine sehe. Und die schönen Regenbögen, die du auf dieser Insel vor dir siehst sind nicht auf natürlichem Weg dahin gelangt.",
        "108799766558011429": "Mir ist nicht klar, ob das für dich irgendeine Gefahr bedeutet, aber es sorgt für ein ungutes Bauchgefühl bei mir. Ich muss mehr nachforschen und melde mich dann bei dir.",
        "108799766558011430": "Pass' auf dich auf, Amiga.",
        "108799766558011431": "GÄÄÄÄÄÄHNNNNN",
        "108799766558011432": "Oh, tut mir leid, Beatrix! Ich hatte in letzter Zeit ein paar wirklich lange Tage und Nächte.",
        "108799766558011433": "Insbesondere habe ich alle Feldführer und botanischen Forschungspapiere durchgeschaut, die ich in der Fernen, Fernen Weite finden konnte.",
        "108799766558011434": "Ich dachte, selbst wenn die Flora auf der Regenbogeninsel unnatürlich ist, gäbe es irgendwo irgendwelche Aufzeichnungen mit nützlichen Informationen.",
        "108799766558011435": "Wie sich heraus stellt, gibt es nichts. Ich konnte keine einzige Erwähnung von Flora in Regenbogenfarben finden, nirgendwo. Das bedeutet also, dass, was auch immer auf der Insel passiert ist, um sie so aussehen zu lassen, erst vor Kurzem geschehen ist.",
        "108799766558011436": "Aber ich glaube nicht, dass du das erst von mir hören musst, denn ich denke, du hast es selbst gesehen. Die Dinge, die du beschrieben hast, ein ganzer Teil der Insel direkt in der Mitte geteilt zwischen zwei Farben...?",
        "108799766558011437": "...das klingt für mich nach \"Unfall\", Beatrix.",
        "108799766558011438": "Also gehe da draußen vorsichtig vor. Die Natur kann für uns gefährlich sein, aber das verblasst im Vergleich zu dem, was wir ihr zufügen können.",
        "108799766558011439": "Ich werde weiter in meiner Bibliothek herumgraben nach irgendwas anderem, was dir helfen könnte. Und wenn ich nichts finde, backe ich dir vielleicht einfach ein paar Muffins!",
        "108799766558011440": "In jedem Fall werde ich was für dich haben, Beatrix. Adios!",
        "108799766558011441": "Hola, Beatrix! Schön, dich zu sehen. Ich hoffe, du hast da draussen gut auf dich aufgepasst und dir die Zeit genommen, gut und reichlich zu essen vor jedem neuen Ausflug ins Unbekannte?",
        "108799766558011442": "Und so wie ich das verstehe, wird es zunehmend spannender und du hast eine Art monolithischer Struktur am anderen Ende der Insel entdeckt?",
        "108799766558011443": "Kann einem Angst machen! Aber vielleicht ist meine Ansicht richtig, dass all die seltsame Flora dort draußen nicht natürlich ist...",
        "108799766558011444": "Irgendwas passt da einfach nicht zusammen, Beatrix. Keine der Ruinen, die wir in der Fernen, Fernen Weite entdeckt haben, sah je so aus, als könnte sie der Umwelt in irgendeiner Form geschadet haben.",
        "108799766558011445": "Klar, wir kennen ihren Zweck nicht und wissen nicht, wer sie gebaut hat, aber es fühlte sich für mich immer so an, als hätten sie diese Welt respektiert.",
        "108799766558011446": "Aber vielleicht ist es einfach passiert. Wenn man wandert, steigt man manchmal sorgfältig über eine Blume, um sie nicht zu zerquetschen, nur um auf eine andere zu treten.",
        "108799766558011447": "Manchmal ist der einzige Weg für diese Blumen, weiter zu wachsen, dass du nie in ihre Nähe kommst.",
        "108799766558011448": "Aber es ist nicht alles trist und trübe. Die Regenbogeninsel scheint bisher zu gedeihen. Die Natur kann ein Gleichgewicht finden, aber das ist nicht garantiert.",
        "108799766558011449": "Ah, jetzt schau mich an, wie ich zu predigen anfange. Tut mir leid, Beatrix, ich werde dich nicht länger aufhalten.",
        "108799766558011450": "Ich weiss nicht, was du jenseits dieser Wände finden wirst, aber ich vertraue deinen Stiefeln in jedem Garten. Ich weiss, du wirst das Richtige tun.",
        "108799766558011451": "Viel Glück, Beatrix.",
        "108799766558011452": "Hey Amiga! Ich habe ein kleines Geschenk für dich. Es ist nicht hausgemacht und kein Kuchen, und kein hausgemachter Kuchen...",
        "108799766558011453": "... aber ich dachte mir, du würdest es trotzdem mögen. Schade allerdings wegen des Kuchens...",
        "108799766558011454": "Hola, Bea! Ich habe dir was gekauft, das da draußen nützlich sein könnte.",
        "108799766558011455": "Aber wenn du schon eins hast, ich kann's nicht umtauschen, insofern... je mehr, desto besser, stimmt's?",
        "108799766558011456": "Hey Bea, ich habe was Besonderes für dich! Schien zu der Zeit genau das richtige...",
        "108799766558011457": "Aber jetzt bin ich nicht so sicher. Öhm, wenn nicht, sag's mir bitte nicht, ich könnte das nicht ertragen!",
        "108799766558011458": "Bea, wenn ich eins über das einsame Forscherleben weiss, das du lebst, dann, dass man nie oft genug daran erinnert werden kann, dass seine Freunde an einen denken.",
        "108799766558011459": "Also ist hier eine Erinnerung! ... in Form eines Geschenks. Lass es dich an mich erinnern und all unsere guten Zeiten zusammen. Ciao, Bea!",
        "108799766558011460": "Hey Amiga, wie geht's dir da draußen? Wenn ich mich allein fühle, gehe ich los und tue was schönes für einen Freund. Fühlt sich jedes Mal toll an!",
        "108799766558011461": "Dies soll nur sagen: Ich denke an dich.",
        "108799766558011462": "Sorry Bea, ich kann nicht quatschen! Alle meine Hühner sind aus dem Gehege geflogen! Ein federsträubender Aufstand da drüben! Wenn ich mich bis morgen nicht melde, haben sie mich abgesetzt.",
        "108799766558011463": "Tut mir leid, Bea, aber ich hole gerade ein sehr großes Soufflee aus dem Ofen, und das erfordert meine höchste Konzentration.",
        "108799766558011464": "Anschließend werde ich ein sehr großes Soufflee verspeisen und das wird meine höchste Konzentration erfordern.",
        "108799766558011465": "Hey Amiga, kann nicht plaudern, ich hab gerade viel vor mir. Insbesondere einen verzwickten Zwiebelsalat, der auf dem Höhepunkt seiner Reife ist.",
        "108799766558011466": "Ich musste dafür so viele Karotten essen, den werde ich mir nicht entgehen lassen!",
        "108799766558011467": "Na wenn das nicht Beatrix LeBeau ist! Der alte Hobby und ich haben gerade erst über dich gesprochen. Man munkelt, du seist zu unbekannten Teilen dieses Felsbrockens aufgebrochen, um neue Abenteuer zu suchen?",
        "108799766558011468": "Prima, Mädchen! Einfach immer weiter laufen auf der Suche nach den neuen Wundern hinter der nächsten Kurve, bis deine Stiefel Löcher kriegen. Und dann besorgst du dir neue Stiefel und machst weiter!",
        "108799766558011469": "Für meinen Teil haben meine Stiefel schon bessere Zeiten erlebt, aber ich weiss, dass noch ein Abenteuer oder zwei in ihnen steckt. Ich schätze, ich muss nur rausfinden, welche...",
        "108799766558011470": "Ach Mensch, ich labere genau wie Hobson es tut, wenn es um die Erforschung des Kosmos, Kochen oder, naja, so ziemlich jedes beliebige Thema geht.",
        "108799766558011471": "Okay Bea, halte durch. Ich werde anrufen, um zu schauen, wie es bei dir läuft. Spielt keine Rolle, wer man ist, wir alle bekommen dieses Gefühl, wenn die Heimat weit hinter dem Horizont liegt.",
        "108799766558011472": "Oh, und bevor ich es vergesse, hier ist eine Kleinigkeit für dich, um deine neue Bude etwas auf Vordermann zu bringen. Ist nichts Wildes, aber man muss tun, was man kann, damit man sich an diesem Ort wohl fühlt.",
        "108799766558011473": "Hiya Bea! Wie ist das Leben da draußen auf der Regenbogeninsel? Macht sogar Spaß, das auszusprechen. Muss toll sein!",
        "108799766558011474": "Weisst du, seit ich gehört habe, dass du unterwegs bist und was Neues machst, habe ich über mein eigenes Leben nachgedacht und was das nächste \"neu\" für mich ist.",
        "108799766558011475": "Hobson und ich haben beide so viel gesehen und erlebt in unseren Leben, ein Abenteuer nach dem anderen auf diesem staubigen Felsen. Und seit wir uns kennen, sind wir kein Stück langsamer geworden.",
        "108799766558011476": "Also suchen wir ein neues Abenteuer, zusammen. Aber wir haben noch nicht rausgefunden, was oder wo.",
        "108799766558011477": "Vielleicht erforschen wir eine versteckte Nische der Fernen, Fernen Weite wie du, oder wir richten sogar unseren Blick auf die Sterne, wie Hobson es schon früher getan hat.",
        "108799766558011478": "Wie auch immer wir uns entscheiden, es wird was ganz Besonderes, weil wir es dieses Mal zusammen machen. Das ist der Teil, der es umso aufregender macht!",
        "108799766558011479": "Es ist so schwierig, jemanden in dieser Welt zu finden, der vollkommen zu dir passt, so eine Seltenheit. Als fände man zwei identische Schneeflocken in der Wüste.",
        "108799766558011480": "... ich weiss, du fühlst das mehr, als ich sagen kann.",
        "108799766558011481": "Ich vergesse nie, wie irre viel Glück ich habe, Bea. Ich will die Geschenke nutzen, die das Universum mir gütigerweise hat zuteil werden lassen.",
        "108799766558011482": "...",
        "108799766558011483": "Kopf hoch, Mädchen. Wir sprechen uns bald wieder.",
        "108799766558011484": "Oh, Bea, gut, dass ich dich erwische. Ich habe große Neuigkeiten, und auf diesem Felsen gibt es nicht gerade viele Ohren, die ich vollquatschen kann.",
        "108799766558011485": "Hobson und ich haben viel darüber nachgedacht, welches Abenteuer für uns als nächstes ansteht. Wir haben gegenseitig unsere Reiseaufzeichnungen gelesen, um Orte zu finden, wo keiner von uns bisher war.",
        "108799766558011486": "Aber auch wenn wir ein paar gefunden haben, hat keiner davon uns wirklich überzeugt. Vielleicht ist das Leben für uns schlussendich langsamer geworden?",
        "108799766558011487": "Dann haben wir geredet und gemerkt, dass wir im Moment nichts lieber hätten, als einfach zusammen auf meiner Ranch zu sein.",
        "108799766558011488": "Diese Ranch war eine der ersten auf der Fernen, Fernen Weite, und wir haben beide so viel gelernt... also haben wir darüber geredet, all das an jemanden weiterzugeben...",
        "108799766558011489": "... also haben Hobson und beschlossen, eine Familie zu gründen, Bea. Und zum ersten Mal, solange ich mich erinnern kann, habe ich Angst!",
        "108799766558011490": "Hobson und ich sind beide so unabhängig, wir haben keinen Schimmer davon, Eltern zu sein, und erst recht nicht davon, ein Kind auf der Fernen, Fernen Weite aufzuziehen.",
        "108799766558011491": "Aber ich liebe den alten Knacker, und der Gedanke an einen Knirps, der mich mit seinen Augen anschaut, lässt mich lächeln...",
        "108799766558011492": "Ich glaube, das allein schon wird mich mich Berge versetzen lassen, damit das funktioniert.",
        "108799766558011493": "Also habe ich hier Arbeit vor mir. So viel auf die Reihe zu kriegen!",
        "108799766558011494": "Danke fürs Zuhören, Bea. Manchmal fühlt man sich schon besser, wenn man seine Sorgen einfach mit jemandem teilt.",
        "108799766558011495": "Pass auf dich auf, Bea.",
        "108799766558011496": "Hi Bea, wie läuft das Erforschen? Man hört, du steckst bis zum Hals in Rätseln da drüben. Klingt aufregend!",
        "108799766558011497": "Ich für meinen Teil frage mich, warum Baby-Kram so unnötig schwierig ist! Ich habe Berge bestiegen, die leichter waren, als eine Krippe mit diesem winzigen seltsamen mitgelieferten Inbusschlüssel zusammen zu bauen...",
        "108799766558011498": "Jedenfalls wollten Hobson und ich uns bedanken. Ich glaube nicht, dass wir gemerkt hätten, dass wir uns ein Kind wünschen, wenn du nicht Teil unseres Lebens wärst.",
        "108799766558011499": "Ich habe immer ein wenig von mir selbst in dir gesehen, und nachdem du Hobsons staubige alte Ranch auf Vordermann gebracht hast, haben wir realisiert, dass nicht nur die Dinge, die wir in der Welt hinterlassen, zählen, sondern, dass es toll ist zu sehen, wie ein jüngerer Haufen etwas Neues damit anfängt.",
        "108799766558011500": "Also wird es wirklich toll zu sehen, was unser Nachwuchs mit dieser Ranch anstellen wird, oder wo ihn sein Herz sonst hinführt.",
        "108799766558011501": "Also danke, Bea! Hobson und ich sind besser dran, weil du ein kleiner Teil unseres Lebens warst! Und ich wünsche dir nur das Beste, immer.",
        "108799766558011502": "Oh, aber eins noch...",
        "108799766558011503": "Hobson wollte wissen, warum du beschlossen hast, das große antike Gerät in den Ruinen der Glaswüste nicht zu nutzen, um dich auf ein Abenteuer quer durch den Kosmos zu begeben?",
        "108799766558011504": "Ich hab ihm gesagt: Hobson Twillgers, die Entscheidung einer Frau, durch Raum und Zeit zu reisen, ist einzig und allein ihre eigene. Aber er ist sowohl stur als auch irre neugierig.",
        "108799766558011505": "...hm?",
        "108799766558011506": "Es war kaputt? Na, das klingt irgendwie nicht richtig... Hobson sagt, er hat das Teil betriebsbereit zurückgelassen, als er gegangen ist. Er wollte die Tür für die nächste abenteuerlustige Seele da draußen offen lassen.",
        "108799766558011507": "Nun, Beatrix LeBeau... scheint so, als hättest du ein weiteres Rätsel gefunden.",
        "108799766558011508": "Viel Glück damit, Bea! Vielleicht solltest du ein Buch schreiben, wenn das hier alles vorbei ist. Würde eine Wahnsinns-Abenteuergeschichte abgeben!",
        "108799766562205696": "Hey Bea. Ich wollte dir was Hübsches geben, also habe ich versucht, dir Kekse zu machen, aber äh... Backen ist nicht gerade mein Fachgebiet...",
        "108799766562205697": "Hobson sagte, sie wären ganz ganz gaaaanz... essbar.",
        "108799766562205698": "... jedenfalls habe ich dir stattdessen etwas gekauft. Ich hoffe, du magst es!",
        "108799766562205699": "Weisst du, Bea, man sagt, die besten Geschenke kommen von Herzen.",
        "108799766562205700": "Dieses kam aus einem Laden... aber dicht dran, richtig?",
        "108799766562205701": "Hey Bea, ich weiss, es ist albern, aber ich sorge mich über all die harte Arbeit, die du da draußen ganz allein erledigst...",
        "108799766562205702": "Also habe ich dir ein kleines Care-Paket geschickt. Hoffentlich gibt es dir ein wenig Extra-Schub!",
        "108799766562205703": "Hahaha, keine Sorge, ich sag's ihr! Sei jetzt still, ich rede mit ihr!",
        "108799766562205704": "Hey Bea, Hobson wollte, dass du das hier bekommst... er sagt, wenn du es nicht willst, kannst du es immer noch verfeuern!",
        "108799766562205705": "Immer wieder schön, von dir zu hören, Süße, aber ich muss los, Hobson abholen - der Traktor ist wieder kaputt draußen auf dem Feld. Ich richte ihm aus, dass du Hallo gesagt hast!",
        "108799766562205706": "Bea, ich fürchte, ich kann gerade nicht quatschen. Hier braut sich ein Unwetter zusammen, ebenso wie der Kaffee, den ich gerade koche. Beides erfordert meine Aufmerksamkeit. Muss los!",
        "108799766562205707": "Sorry Bea, ich brauche diese Leitung für Hobson. Er hat diesen Kumpel, mit dem er den ganzen Tag plappert über wer weiss was alles. Seltsamer Typ in einem Trenchcoat. Ich kann mit dem nichts anfangen.",

        "418299640694861848": "Du hast mir also den Brief und das Boot geschickt, das mich hierhergebracht hat?",

        "433468706430545920": "Hallo noch mal, Beatrix. Brauchst du etwas?",
        "434144876759248896": "Ist es nicht wunderschön? Trotz allem ist ein Teil von mir einfach froh, das alles erneut zu sehen …",
        "434144879288414208": "Bin ich noch … im Labyrinth …?",
        "434144879774953472": "Ich war in einem Raum mit komischen Lichtern und alles war echt verrückt.",
        "434144880240521216": "Ich werde weiter erkunden.",
        "434144880701894656": "Ja, du bist wirklich noch im Labyrinth. Das ist eine vollständige Nachbildung der Umgebungsaspekte draußen, bis hin zur Atmosphäre.",
        "434144881163268096": "Aber die Größe von alldem ist sogar noch beeindruckender. Es ist innen tatsächlich größer als außen. Total verrückt!",
        "434144881654001664": "Nicht alles hier wird direkt einen Sinn ergeben. Oder überhaupt jemals. Tu einfach, was du am besten kannst: erkunden, sammeln und herausfinden, wie man sich an diesem Ort zurechtfindet.",
        "434144882119569408": "Wenn du dich hier auskennst und verstehst, wie hier alles funktioniert, wird das später noch nützlich sein.",
        "434144882580942848": "Wenn Teile des Labyrinths plötzlich schimmern und in hellem Licht explodieren, musst du aufpassen.",
        "434144883059093504": "Ich nenne das Prismastörung. Es sind instabile Energieschübe des Prismakerns. Sie breiten sich in Wellen aus, also musst du lernen, sie zu erkennen und zu überleben.",
        "434144883512078336": "Denn auch wenn die Störungen gefährlich sich, werden sie sich für unsere Arbeit hier als unerlässlich herausstellen … mit der Zeit.",
        "434144883965063168": "Okay, Beatrix, du weißt, wo du mich findest, wenn du mich brauchst … Na ja, mehr oder weniger.",
        "434160849277054976": "Hast du schon den Sonnenuntergang im Labyrinth gesehen? Die dunkle Nacht fließt herein und trotzdem ist alles nur eine Illusion. Oder zumindest muss es so sein …",
        "434160851747500032": "Apropos Dunkelheit, was sind dieses schattenartigen Slimes, die ich gesehen hab?",
        "434160852200484864": "Warum vertraust du mir das alles an, Gigi?",
        "434160852657664000": "Ich sollte weitergehen.",
        "434160853140008960": "Schatten-Slimes sind eine merkwürdige Slime-Variation. Sie scheinen die manifestierte, entgegengesetzte Polarität des Prismakerns zu sein.",
        "434160853597188096": "Ich weiß immer noch nicht, ob jemand sie absichtlich als eine Art Gegenkraft erschaffen hat oder ob sie sich einfach so entwickelt haben. Die Natur findet einen Weg, nicht wahr?",
        "434160854066950144": "Auf jeden Fall scheinen Schatten-Plorts einen dämpfenden Effekt auf Prismastörungen zu haben. Es ist nur eine vage Hoffnung, aber vielleicht kann man mit ihnen die Effekte des Prismakerns negieren.",
        "434160854532517888": "Irgendwelche Tipps zu Schatten-Slimes?",
        "434160855006474240": "Schlüpfrige kleine Kerlchen, was? Schatten-Slimes fliehen sofort vor dir oder Prismastörungen. Du solltest also an Orten suchen, die nicht gerade erst eine Prismastörung erlebt haben.",
        "434160855480430592": "Sobald du eine Gruppe gefunden hast, musst du dich anschleichen und versuchen, so viele Plorts wie möglich zu ergattern, bevor sie fliehen. Bring also auf jeden Fall nen Haufen Zeugs im Vac-Pack mit.",
        "434160855937609728": "Aber pass auf, dass du ihnen nicht über eine Klippe hinterherjagst. Ich spreche hier definitiv nicht aus Erfahrung … puh.",
        "434160856415760384": "Ich bin keine Heldin, Beatrix. Also wusste ich, dass ich eine echte Heldin brauche, um das hier aufzuhalten.",
        "434160856881328128": "Und zwar eine Heldin, der ich vertrauen kann. Denn wer wäre sonst dafür geeignet? Also hab ich versucht, mir die perfekte Person für diesen Job vorzustellen. Und das warst du.",
        "434160857334312960": "Ich wurde schon mal enttäuscht. So ist überhaupt erst alles schiefgegangen. Ich hab den falschen Leuten vertraut. Aber jetzt hab ich die Chance, alles wiedergutzumachen.",
        "434160857791492096": "Du spürst es vielleicht noch nicht, aber in dir steckt eine Heldin, Beatrix. Du wirst eine werden. Vor dir liegen so viele großartige Abenteuer, versprochen.",
        "434160858261254144": "Irgendwann wird das hier einfach ein weiteres Kapitel unter den Abenteuern Beatrix LeBeaus sein. Eine weitere Geschichte, die ein kleines Mädchen unter einem Baum liest und sie träumen lässt, ihr Leben wäre auch so eine atemberaubende Geschichte …",
        "434160858726821888": "Ich bring immer gern Lichts ins Dunkel, wenn nötig.",
        "434166468247711744": "Man kann sich so leicht in Gedanken verlieren, wenn man diese merkwürdige Architektur anschaut und sich fragt, woher das alles kommt, oder?",
        "434166470726545408": "Was denkst du, wer diesen Ort erbaut hat?",
        "434166471175335936": "Was ist mit dir, Gigi? Woher kommst du?",
        "434166471632515072": "Ich sollte weitergehen.",
        "434166472085499904": "Überall in der fernen, fernen Weite gibt es Hinweise darauf, dass hier vor langer Zeit schon einmal jemand oder etwas war. Verfallene Ruinen und die Überreste antiker technologischer Geräte sind auf dem ganzen Planeten verstreut.",
        "434166472546873344": "Diese Ruinen waren schon immer ein Rätsel, denn sie scheinen keine besondere Funktion zu haben. Keine, die wir erkennen können. Und dann all die Slime-Statuen überall!",
        "434166473004052480": "Aber das Labyrinth ist anders. Ich glaube, es wurde aus einem bestimmten Grund errichtet.",
        "434166473478008832": "Und welcher Grund soll das sein?",
        "434166473964548096": "Ich glaube, der Prismakern wurde vor langer Zeit entdeckt und dieses Labyrinth wurde als Sicherheits- und Forschungseinrichtung darum herum gebaut.",
        "434166474417532928": "Sie konnten die Effekte des Prismakerns nicht aufhalten, also haben sie versucht, den Rest der fernen, fernen Weite davon abzuschotten, während sie nach einer Lösung suchten.",
        "434166474862129152": "Das Labyrinth wurde als autarkes Ökosystem konzipiert. Ich denke, es sollte Teile der Regenbogeninsel simulieren. So konnte man beobachten, wie sich der Prismakern im Laufe der Zeit darauf auswirkt.",
        "434166475315113984": "Außerhalb des Labyrinths findet man hauptsächlich chromatische Veränderungen, aber im Inneren sind die Effekte noch verstärkt und elementare Eigenschaften verändern sich vollständig.",
        "434166475772293120": "Wir finden einen Weg, das aufzuhalten.",
        "434166476250443776": "Mit der Zeit. Das hoffe ich. Mit der Zeit …",
        "434166476711817216": "Die Frage ist gar nicht so leicht zu beantworten. Ich komme eigentlich von einem Ort, der gar nicht weit von dem entfernt ist, den du jetzt dein Zuhause nennst. Aber wir hätten uns vorher nicht begegnen können.",
        "434166477168996352": "Ich wurde in der fernen, fernen Weite geboren. Sie ist meine Heimat und alles andere kenne ich nur aus Büchern.",
        "434166477621981184": "Als ich die Regenbogeninsel entdeckte, fühlte sich alles einfach so neu an, wie ein geheimer Raum im Zuhause deiner Kindheit. Ich wollte für immer dortbleiben.",
        "434166478079160320": "Aber jetzt fühlt es sich an, als hätte ich schon so viele Leben gelebt. Meine Kindheit war eines davon. Und mein Leben auf der Regenbogeninsel ein anderes. Und jetzt, wo ich wieder hier bin, ist es wohl ein weiteres. Aber alles verschwimmt irgendwie.",
        "434166478590865408": "Wie meinst du das?",
        "434166479039655936": "Die Art, wie ich hierher zurückgekommen bin, um hier alles geradezubiegen … Na ja, das war nicht die Standardart zu reisen. Und in meinem Kopf ist jetzt immer alles wie vernebelt, ein bisschen durcheinander.",
        "434166479530389504": "Meine Erinnerungen fühlen sich irgendwie neu geordnet an, als wären sie vermischt worden. Was ich gestern getan hab, fühlt sich manchmal so weit weg an, wie ein halb vergessener Augenblick aus meiner Kindheit …",
        "434166479983374336": "… und die Kindheitserinnerungen sind plötzlich kristallklar. Manchmal fühlen sie sich sogar ganz neu an.",
        "434166480478302208": "In meiner frühesten Erinnerung sitze ich unter unserem Esstisch und beobachte, wie meine Mutter das Wohnzimmer saugt. Sie wusste nicht, dass ich da war, und ich hab ihr einfach zugesehen.",
        "434166480927092736": "Ich erinnere mich daran, dass es ein heißer Tag war. Sie sah müde aus und irgendwie aufgebracht. Und das war’s.",
        "434166481380077568": "Aber seit ich zurückgekommen bin, hat sich diese Erinnerung verändert. Ich bin immer noch unter dem Tisch und sie saugt immer noch. Es ist heiß und sie ist müde …",
        "434166481862422528": "Aber dann bemerkt sie mich. Erst ist sie überrascht, dann erfreut und dann hört sie auf zu saugen.",
        "434166482319601664": "Sie kniet sich hin und wir reden, aber ich kann meine eigenen Worte nicht hören. Ich sehe nur, wie sie zuhört und lächelt.",
        "434166482772586496": "Viel Spaß beim Erkunden!",
        "434169717507911680": "Dieser Ausblick … Man kann sich so leicht in seiner Schönheit verlieren. Zumindest, bis eine Prismastörung alles ins Chaos stürzt.",
        "434169719974162432": "Ja, es ist auch ohne sie schwer genug, sich hier zurechtzufinden.",
        "434169720464896000": "Das dachte ich mir schon, deshalb hab ich ein Gerät entwickelt, das dir helfen könnte.",
        "434169720938852352": "Ich nenne es Störungsdetektor, und genau das tut es auch: Wenn du diese Geräte im Labyrinth platzierst, melden sie dir, wenn in einem Gebiet eine Prismastörung bevorsteht. Klappt sogar auf deiner Karte!",
        "434169721408614400": "Ich gebe dir einen, den ich selbst gebaut hab, und den Bauplan dazu. Dann kannst du so viele herstellen, wie du brauchst.",
        "434169721878376448": "Wie benutze ich diesen Störungsdetektor noch mal?",
        "434169722331361280": "Wie komme ich an Prisma-Plorts?",
        "434169722817900544": "Ich muss wieder los.",
        "434169723275079680": "Keine Sorge, in meinem Kopf geht auch manchmal alles durcheinander. Eine der Nebenwirkungen von, na ja …",
        "434169723770007552": "Also, Störungsdetektoren funktionieren ganz einfach. Stelle einen her und platziere ihn an einem Ort im Labyrinth, an dem du Prismastörungen verfolgen willst.",
        "434169724218798080": "Sobald er platziert ist, informiert dich der Störungsdetektor, wenn eine Prismastörung bevorsteht oder gerade in diesem Gebiet aktiv ist.",
        "434169724671782912": "Prisma-Plorts findest du innerhalb der chaotischen Prismastörungen im Labyrinth. Prismastörungen lassen Gebiete plötzlich mit prismatischer Energie aufleuchten. Der Effekt verstärkt sich mit der Zeit.",
        "434169725158322176": "Während dieser Störungen kannst du Nahrung am Boden sehen, die durch die Auswirkungen des Prismakerns instabil geworden ist. Wenn du damit Slimes fütterst, produzieren diese Slimes instabile Plorts.",
        "434169725653250048": "Instabile Plorts? Wie stabilisiere ich die?",
        "434169726093651968": "Instabile Plorts können mit Stabilisatoren in Prisma-Plorts umgewandelt werden. Die Stabilisatoren findest du im Labyrinth. Soweit ich weiß, gibt es sie in zwei Varianten.",
        "434169726567608320": "Die großen ringförmigen Ur-Stabilisatoren im Labyrinth sind leicht zu erkennen.",
        "434169727016398848": "Aber die ätherischen Temporalstabilisatoren tauchen während der Prismastörungen zufällig als kleine goldene Energieringe auf. Störungen sind ziemlich chaotisch, also pass gut auf.",
        "434169727490355200": "Welche du auch wählst, wenn du instabile Plorts durch diese Ringe schießt, erhältst du Prisma-Plorts. Und durch Ur-Stabilisatoren kannst du sogar selbst hindurchspringen. So werden alle deine Plorts auf einmal stabilisiert. Das macht Spaß!",
        "434169727981088768": "Viel Spaß beim Erkunden!",
        "434189984019935232": "Offenbar bist du echt gut darin, Geheimnisse zu finden. Ich hab ewig gebraucht, um diesen Ort zu entdecken.",
        "434189987203411968": "Geheimnisse scheinen das Grundgerüst dieses Ortes zu sein.",
        "434189987656396800": "Apropos Geheimnisse, warum hast du so getan, als wärst du eine KI?",
        "434189988105187328": "Dann also auf zum nächsten Geheimnis …",
        "434189988549783552": "Anscheinend. Ich vermute, dass der seltsame Grundriss zumindest teilweise entstanden ist, weil das Labyrinth im Laufe der Zeit immer weiter gebaut wurde. Schließlich mussten immer kreativere Lösungen genutzt werden, um es noch größer zu machen.",
        "434189989002768384": "Kreative Lösungen?",
        "434189989472530432": "Das Labyrinth scheint ja innen größer zu sein als außen, nicht wahr? Ich glaube, diese Technologie wurde irgendwie vom Prismakern selbst übernommen.",
        "434189989963264000": "Das klingt zwar verrückt, aber die Prismakernenergie in ihrer konzentriertesten Form kann offenbar die Realität selbst verformen.",
        "434189990416248832": "Ich denke, das Labyrinth wurde irgendwann erweitert, um möglichst alle Prismakernenergie einzudämmen. Und als das nicht gereicht hat, wurde eine Art realitätsumformende Technologie eingesetzt, damit es noch größer werden konnte.",
        "434189990873427968": "Aber am Ende muss alles versagt haben. Und jetzt strahlt die Prismakernenergie aus dem Labyrinth über die gesamte Regenbogeninsel.",
        "434189991326412800": "Tut mir leid, aber ich musste sicher sein, dass ich Viktor vertrauen kann und dass er herausfinden kann, was ich nicht konnte. Die Tore zum Labyrinth waren dir versperrt, aber mir nicht. Zumindest nicht mehr.",
        "434189991829729280": "Als ich zum ersten Mal den Prismakern sah, bevor ich hierherkam, als die Katastrophe eintrat … das hat etwas an mir verändert. Ich habe versucht, mich vor der Explosion zu schützen. Und ich habe überlebt, aber irgendetwas war anders.",
        "434189992282714112": "Ein Teil der Energiesignatur des Prismakerns ist nun ein Teil von mir. Deshalb kann ich mich ihm nicht nähern. Und darum brauche ich deine Hilfe.",
        "434189992735698944": "Du musst verstehen, dass ich nicht zulassen konnte, dass so etwas noch einmal passiert. Ich durfte die Schlüssel zu diesem Ort nicht der falschen Person in die Hände drücken … Du musst mir einfach vertrauen, wenn ich sage, dass dies unsere letzte Chance ist.",
        "434189993218043904": "Für mich gibt es kein Zurück.",
        "434189993696194560": "Wenn jemand es finden kann, dann du, Beatrix.",
        "434192420939919360": "Ich nenne diesen Ort das Traumland. Ich bin immer gern hierhergekommen und hab Stunden zwischen den Wolken verbracht. Ein schöner Ort, um die eigenen Probleme zu vergessen.",
        "434192423401975808": "Erzeugt das Labyrinth hier seine Atmosphäre?",
        "434192423859154944": "Hast du Träume, Gigi?",
        "434192424307945472": "Ich sollte das Traumland wohl selbst erkunden.",
        "434192424760930304": "Ja, ich denke schon, vielleicht sogar mehr als das. Die Luft hier ist irgendwie anders. Schwer zu erklären. Es ist, als würden die Wolken und sogar die Inseln, auf denen du jetzt stehst, aus dem Äther um dich herum geformt werden.",
        "434192425192943616": "Nicht gebaut oder zusammengesetzt, eher aus winzigen Nichtigkeiten in der Luft zusammengesammelt. Ich hab so viel Zeit auf diesen Inseln verbracht und manchmal war ich mir sicher, diesen Fluss erkennen zu können. Als würde ich fast die Kontrolle darüber erlangen.",
        "434192425650122752": "Einmal hatte ich Heimweh, während ich hier saß. Ich dachte daran, wie ich als Kind abends im Garten meiner Mutter gespielt hab und dann der Duft vom Abendessen aus unserem Haus herüberwehte.",
        "434192426132467712": "Ich liebte es, das Gemüse direkt vor mir wachsen zu sehen, während ich gleichzeitig ihr gekochtes Aroma roch. Es war, als wäre alles miteinander verbunden.",
        "434192426606424064": "Und dann saß ich hier und schloss meine Augen und stellte mir den Garten vor. Und ich schwöre, ich konnte das Abendessen riechen.",
        "434192427101351936": "Als ich die Augen wieder öffnete, war weit vor mir eine neue Insel, und darauf stand das Haus, in dem ich aufgewachsen bin. Aber ich sah es nur einen kurzen Augenblick, dann verschwand es in den Wolken …",
        "434192427579502592": "Ich hatte früher viele Träume. Ich wollte mich von den Erwartungen befreien, die meine Eltern an mich stellten. Ich wollte meinen eigenen Weg wählen. Also träumte ich davon, wegzulaufen und die Person zu werden, die ich wirklich sein wollte.",
        "434192428028293120": "Ich träumte davon, dass sie eines Tages diese Person sehen und sich für mich freuen. Und dann wäre alles irgendwie wieder in Ordnung. Es wäre egal, dass ich sie verlassen hatte.",
        "434192428472889344": "Aber wenn man jung ist, sieht man manchmal nicht, wie kaputt die Dinge direkt vor einem sind. Deine Version der Welt ist dann wie ein beschlagener Badezimmerspiegel. Du siehst die Formen, aber nicht die Einzelheiten.",
        "434192428925874176": "Heute weiß ich, dass meine Mutter den Tod meiner Großmutter nie überwunden hat. Mir war damals nicht klar, dass sie unter so großem Druck stand, ihr Vermächtnis fortzuführen, und dass die Trauer ein Teil ihres Lebens wurde … Das begriff ich erst lange, nachdem ich weg war.",
        "434192429374664704": "Jetzt träume ich davon, dass ich irgendwann zurück nach Hause kann und meine Eltern irgendwie verstehen, warum ich gehen musste. Ich glaube, darum geht es immer … Du willst nur, dass sie dich verstehen.",
        "434192429836038144": "Pass gut auf hier draußen. Träume können auch einfach enden.",
        "434196761864204288": "Hallo, Beatrix. Offenbar bist du noch nicht im Traum gefangen.",
        "434196764397563904": "Hier scheint sich alles in Gold zu verwandeln …",
        "434196764867325952": "Fühlst du dich verloren, Gigi?",
        "434196765337088000": "Ja, da das Traumland dem Prismakern so nah ist, kannst du einige der heftigsten Auswirkungen sehen.",
        "434196765790072832": "Ich hab hier drin gesehen, wie sich Wasser in Glas verwandelt, Bäume in Metall. Und ganze Gebilde um den Prismakern herum wurden fast unsichtbar und verschwanden dann vollständig, als wären sie einfach aus der Realität ausgelöscht.",
        "434196766251446272": "Das ganze Traumland wird sich Stück für Stück in Gold verwandeln, wenn wir es nicht aufhalten. Wo du stehst, wird alles schwer werden und vom Himmel fallen. Mit der Zeit wird die erzeugte Atmosphäre zusammenbrechen und das Labyrinth weiter destabilisieren.",
        "434196766717014016": "Und wenn das Labyrinth erst kollabiert und sich die Prismakernenergie über die gesamte ferne, ferne Weite ausbreitet, wird diese Welt zur Unkenntlichkeit verändert werden und dabei alles Leben auf dem Planeten auslöschen.",
        "434196767195164672": "Die Slimes …",
        "434196767660732416": "Ja, selbst die zähen Slimes können so eine Katastrophe nicht überleben. Aber das lassen wir nicht zu. Wir beide finden einen Weg.",
        "434196768130494464": "Ich fühle mich immer verloren. Aber vielleicht nie so sehr wie zu der Zeit, als ich die Glaswüste durchquerte.",
        "434196768587673600": "Du bist durch die Glaswüste gereist?",
        "434196769053241344": "Ja, sogar zweimal. Unglaublich, was? Und ehrlich gesagt hat es mich auch fast umgebracht …",
        "434196769531392000": "Als ich die Glaswüste erforscht habe, empfand ich den Namen kaum angemessen. Denn was ich sah, war grün und voller Leben.",
        "434196769996959744": "Das liegt an dem besonderen Wasser, das dort fließt und Dinge fast magisch wachsen lässt. Aber wem erzähle ich das. Du weißt das alles.",
        "434196770475110400": "Darum hatte ich mich damals nicht gut genug vorbereitet. Und auf der Rückreise … machte die Glaswüste ihrem Namen alle Ehre.",
        "434196770932289536": "Eine karge Einöde. Der Wind stach im Gesicht und blendete mich. Und wann immer ich dachte, ich könnte mich orientieren, ging die Welt um mich herum in Flammen auf.",
        "434196771376885760": "Wie hast du es geschafft, weiterzugehen?",
        "434196771855036416": "Gigi hält einen Moment inne und streicht über ihren zerlumpten Umhang.",
        "434196772320604160": "Der Umhang gehörte meiner Großmutter. Eigentlich ist es eine Decke, die sie sich immer um die Beine wickelte, als sie schon alt war. Zumindest hab ich das in Fotos gesehen. Und dann gehörte sie meiner Mutter, die sie schließlich mir gab.",
        "434196772781977600": "Meine Mutter flickte jeden Riss immer sofort. So viele kleine Nähte, die nie ganz zueinander passten. Sie versuchte so sehr, alles zusammenzuhalten.",
        "434196773243351040": "Einmal saß ich auf dem Boden einer Höhle und lauschte dem tosenden Sturm draußen. Ich war in meinen Umhang gehüllt und weinte einfach, so schwer war die Last. Ich war müde und alles war einfach unerträglich.",
        "434196773717307392": "Und da spürte ich, wie meine Mutter mich beschützte. Ich sah all die schiefen Nähte, in die ich gewickelt war, und mir wurde klar, dass sie für mich alles zusammengehalten hat. Was immer es auch gekostet hatte.",
        "434196774170292224": "Und jetzt ist die Decke zwar zerrissen und verschlissen und sie wird nie wieder sein wie früher, aber sie ist immer noch hier. Sie hat mich gerettet, so wie wir diesen Ort retten werden. Er wird wohl auch nie wieder sein wie früher, aber wir werden ihn zusammenhalten, Beatrix.",
        "434196774627471360": "Weiter so, Beatrix.",
        "434198584142491648": "Ich kann kaum glauben, dass du so weit gekommen bist, Beatrix. Das Labyrinth würde eine normale Person einfach verschlingen, aber du, du bist anders. Es war richtig, dir zu vertrauen.",
        "434198586608742400": "Vor dir liegt der Prismakern. Gemeinsam haben wir nun vielleicht eine Chance, das alles aufzuhalten und die Zukunft der fernen, fernen Weite zu verändern …",
        "434198587065921536": "Die Auflösung unserer Geschichte erwartet euch in unserem nächsten Inhaltsupdate! In der Zwischenzeit solltet ihr unbedingt das Labyrinth erkunden, überall mit Gigi plaudern und mit Geräten eine Umgebung erschaffen, die euch auf euren Reisen hilft.",
        "434198587523100672": "Vielen Dank für eure Unterstützung, euer Feedback und eure Begeisterung für Slime Rancher. Wir können es kaum erwarten, euch die nächsten Neuheiten zu bringen!",
        "434198587980279808": "Wann erscheint das nächste Inhaltsupdate?",
        "434198588420681728": "Wie kann ich Slime Rancher noch besser machen?",
        "434198588886249472": "Ich liebe Slimes wirklich sehr.",
        "434198589339234304": "Ich bin bereit für weitere Erkundungsreisen!",
        "434198589813190656": "Wenn du direkt alle Neuigkeiten erfahren möchtest, folge Slime Rancher in den sozialen Medien oder abonniere unseren Newsletter unter <style=\"weblink\"><link=\"https://gsght.com/c/4l9e90\">slimerancher.com</link></style>.",
        "434198590266175488": "Slime Rancher kann nur durch die Unterstützung unserer Community existieren. Du kannst uns unterstützen, indem du Reviews für Slime Rancher schreibst, dein Spiel streamst oder dich mit Mitgliedern unserer Community darüber unterhältst.",
        "434198590719160320": "Du hilfst uns bereits, wenn du Freund*innen, Verwandten oder einer besonders einflussreichen Katze aus deiner Umgebung davon erzählst!",
        "434198591176339456": "Und sie lieben dich auch wirklich sehr.",
        "434627962089402368": "Ich sah, wie sich Wasser in Glas verwandelte. Blumen in Metall. Grausam.",
        "434627965256101888": "Und dann ändert sich ihr Gesichtsausdruck wieder. Sie lächelt immer noch, und ich sehe Tränen in ihren Augenwinkeln, aber sie hält sie zurück.",
        "434629957986709504": "Das klappt sogar auf deiner Karte. Also platziere eine Menge davon und decke das Labyrinth so weiträumig wie möglich ab, wenn du haufenweise Prisma-Plorts sammeln willst. Die werden wir brauchen.",
        "434629960771727360": "Na ja, es würde Spaß machen, wenn um dich herum nicht gerade gefährliche Energien explodieren würden, während instabile Plorts aus deinem Tank fliegen …",
        "434634062582935552": "Aber auf jeden Fall ist es ein Abenteuer, oder?",
        "434637451849003008": "In gewisser Weise kam ich gerade rechtzeitig an diesen Ort. Rechtzeitig und wohl auch ziemlich unzeitgemäß …",
        "434638300511891456": "… Ich weiß immer noch nicht, ob es real war oder nicht.",
        "434639513852735488": "Ich hab so viele Tage damit verbracht, mich in Höhlen zu verkriechen, auf der Suche nach genug Mut, um weiterzumachen. Aber ich wusste einfach, dass ich zur Regenbogeninsel zurückmusste, um eine Lösung zu finden.",
        "442195192629063680": "Und dann sagt sie, es würde ihr leidtun, dass meine Großmutter mich nie kennenlernen konnte.",
        "442195194155790336": "Sie legt mir die Hand auf die Schulter und will gerade noch etwas sagen, aber die Kommunikationsstation meldet sich und sie dreht den Kopf.",
        "442195194625552384": "Danach kann ich mich an nichts mehr erinnern.",
        "428361726019923968": "Beatrix! Ich habe eine weitere Nachricht der \"KI\" erhalten, mit der ich seit deiner Ankunft auf der Regenbogeninsel in Kontakt stehe.",
        "428361726045089792": "Die Nachricht war mehr oder minder an mich persönlich gerichtet, enthielt aber auch wichtige Informationen für dich, daher zitiere ich sie wörtlich, um alles Wichtige zu überbringen …",
        "428361726045089793": "Ähem! ",
        "428361726045089794": "\"Viktor, danke für die vielen Unterhaltungen, die wir im Laufe dieser vielen Tage geführt haben, in denen ich dich besser kennenlernen durfte. Ich muss zugeben, dass ich unsere Korrespondenz mit dem Ziel geführt habe, deine wissenschaftlichen Fähigkeiten zu überprüfen.",
        "428361726045089795": "Unsere Korrespondenz hat mich dieser nicht nur versichert, sondern auch Trost und einen Gefährten in jenen dunklen Tagen geboten, die jetzt über mich hereinbrechen.",
        "428361726045089796": "Ich schicke dir den Teil eines Bauplans für ein Gerät, das ich entwickeln wollte, aber nicht konnte. Sollte dir die Vollendung gelingen, so glaube ich, dass du einen Schlüssel für das Graue Labyrinth besitzt. ",
        "428361726045089797": "Bitte verstehe, Viktor, dass ich niemals vorhatte, dich zu täuschen. Aber ich muss einfach wissen, wem ich vertrauen kann, um die Dinge in Ordnung bringen zu können. Sollte mir das eines Tages gelingen, dann würde ich dich gerne treffen.",
        "428361726045089798": "Ich würde mich freuen, mit dir bei einer Tasse Kaffee noch eine Partie Go zu spielen, bis die Sonne einmal mehr aufgeht.\"",
        "428361726045089799": "… und mehr steht dort nicht.",
        "428361726045089800": "Mir wurde ein komplexer Bauplan mit einigen teilweise vorhanden Schemata und einem offen gesprochen fast fremdartigen Code überlassen. Ich habe Tage für die Analyse aufgewendet und glaube, dass ich ihn in einen funktionsfähigen Zustand für jene Aufgabe versetzt habe, für die er entwickelt wurde.",
        "428361726045089801": "Zumindest hoffe ich das. Ehrlich gesagt möchte ich diese Person nicht im Stich lassen. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass ich ihr was schuldig bin … als Freund.",
        "428361726045089802": "Ich möchte dir daher den vollendeten Bauplan schicken und damit den erhaltenen Anweisungen folgen. Er scheint für ein Gerät zu sein, das du bei den Eingängen zum Labyrinth benutzen musst. Aber ich fürchte, mehr weiß ich auch nicht.",
        "428361726045089803": "Solltest du dir nicht sicher sein, wie du es einsetzen sollst, dann versuche es mit Experimentieren! Das ist der einzige Weg, das Unbekannte kennenzulernen.",
        "428361726045089804": "Viel Glück, Beatrix. Offenbar zählen wir nun alle auf dich.",
        "497217680223924224": "Hallo noch mal! Ich hab die Tauschstation mit meiner Anlage hier verknüpft. Jetzt können wir Zeug, das du findest, gegen Zeug tauschen, das ich herstellen kann.",
        "497217686565711872": "Und vielleicht die Harmonisierer ...",
        "494426433331556352": "Das hoffe ich. Ich vermute, dass der Grund für alles Instabile und Seltsame hier die Prismawellen sind, die das Labyrinth bedecken und Dinge transmutieren. Wenn ich etwas entwickeln könnte, um sie in einem abgegrenzten Bereich zu neutralisieren, könntest du vielleicht herausfinden, wo die Harmonisierer versteckt sind.\n",
        "494426435990745088": "Wie baut man so etwas?",
        "494426436984795136": "Also erst mal brauch ich Prisma-Plorts, um Baupläne zu erstellen. Ich muss alle möglichen Prismatests durchführen, um die Parameter für unsere Arbeit zu ermitteln.",
        "503065643299008514": "Was den Bau angeht … Diese komischen Schatten-Slimes könnten helfen. Ihre Plorts besitzen eine natürliche dämpfende Wirkung auf Prismawellen. Vielleicht haben sie sich so entwickelt? Sie können die Wellenlängen abflachen, um …",
        "503065643299008515": "Entschuldige, ich bin gerade ganz schön beschäftigt. Halt Ausschau nach Schatten-Plorts. Die könnten später noch nützlich sein. Und bring mir in der Zwischenzeit deine Prisma-Plorts, dann kann ich mit dem Annullierer anfangen.",
        "494426436498255872": "Alles klar.",
        "503065643299008518": "Wir haben es fast geschafft, Beatrix. Durchhalten!",
        "512531865044414464": "Ich verlass mich darauf, dass du diese Plorts beschaffst, damit ich den Bauplan für den Annullierer entwickeln kann. Ist ein Schuss ins Blaue, aber wir müssen einfach hoffen, Beatrix.",
        "512855595578716160": "Du hast jetzt meinen Annullierer-Bauplan und kannst ihn am Fabrikator im Gewächshaus bauen. Danach musst du nach versteckten Bereichen hinter seltsamen Wänden suchen.",
        "512528636512464896": "Halt Ausschau nach komischen Wänden. Wenn du den Annullierer davor einsetzt, sollte er dir einen Weg freimachen. Hoffentlich findest du dort dann die Harmonisierer, damit wir versuchen können, den Prismakern zu stabilisieren.",
        "515408179648688128": "Dies ist eine aufgezeichnete Nachricht: Du hast alle Harmonisierer aktiviert! Komm zum Prismakern, um mit mir zu reden. Jetzt beginnt die richtige Arbeit ...",
        "515407435033899008": "Aufgezeichnete Nachricht: Hi, Beatrix! Die Tauschstation ist auf Automatik gestellt. Du kannst jederzeit Prisma-Plorts einwerfen, um Regenbogenmünzen zu bekommen. Viel Spaß!",
        "459162059549601792": "Hi, Beatrix. Offenbar müssen noch einige Harmonisierer aktiviert werden.\r",
        "512135795118338048": "Benutze den Annullierer, um im Labyrinth versteckte Pfade freizulegen. Suche nach Wänden, die seltsam aussehen, als wären sie von Prismawellen verändert worden.",
        "512137435087007744": "Klasse! Du hast alle Harmonisierer aktiviert. Wir sind schon fast dazu in der Lage, den Prismakern zu stabilisieren.",
        "512137648556109824": "Wir brauchen erst noch eine Menge Wasser, aber offenbar hast du noch keinen Wassertank. Fertige einen am Fabrikator im Gewächshaus. Wenn du bereit bist, komm wieder und sag mir Bescheid.",
        "508172740122537984": "Für Notfälle hab ich diese Wasserdusche gebastelt, aber hier läuft kein Wasser. Es gibt nur einen Haufen Rohre. Wenn wir irgendwie das Wasser zum Laufen kriegen, wär das sicher nützlich ... Glaub mir.",
        "508173982047563776": "Ich erkläre es später genauer.\r",
        "459162940231806976": "Dann mal los.",
        "459163070364282880": "Ich muss mich noch vorbereiten.",
        "459163407372414976": "Komm wieder, wenn du bereit bist. Ich warte.",
        "459163883820183552": "Okay, ich zähl auf dich, Beatrix.\r",
        "512137991872475136": "Das war’s, Beatrix. Mit den aktiven Harmonisierern und dank deiner Hilfe kann ich versuchen, den Prismakern zu stabilisieren.",
        "512152448220688384": "Beatrix! Die Werte vom Prismakern ... Sie sind stabil! Das ist eine ganz andere Wellenlänge als vorher! Ich ... Ich kann es spüren.",
        "512404458169856000": "Da ist er, Beatrix ... Der Prismakern.\r",
        "512404595482980352": "Als ich ihn zuerst sah, verschlug es mir den Atem. Wie sich das Licht darin bewegt und windet, wie es sich mit jedem Augenblick verändert ... als würde man in die Unendlichkeit starren. Hätte ich damals nur gewusst, was daraus werden würde. Aus mir ... Aus allem.",
        "512405717933256704": "Es tut mir leid, dass ich dich hierhergebracht und in all das hineingezogen habe. Aber es gab keinen anderen Weg.\r",
        "512520617573642240": "Und wie gesagt, ich denke, ich kann etwas herstellen, das versteckte Pfade im Labyrinth aufdecken kann.",
        "512775262921453568": "Es wird lange dauern, bis sich das Land vollständig erholt und Effekte wie die Prismastörungen aufhören. Aber die Regenbogeninsel – nein, die Zukunft der ganzen fernen, fernen Weite wurde gerettet. Das warst du, Beatrix. Wir haben es geschafft. Ich kann dir gar nicht genug danken.",
        "522633243620175872": "Zum Glück bist du zurück! Ich konnte den Vorgang gerade noch stoppen und den Raum säubern. Ich bin so froh, dass ich diese Notfalldusche eingebaut hatte!",
        "523379801986854912": "Hi, Beatrix. Dieses Gebiet nenne ich das Terrarium.",
        "523379806806110208": "Warum „Terrarium“?",
        "523379807615610880": "Was passiert hier? Artenschutz?",
        "523379808395751424": "Ich schau mich mal um.",
        "523379809226223616": "Na ja ... Ein Terrarium ist nur ein Behältnis, in dem Pflanzen außerhalb ihrer natürlichen Umgebung gehalten werden.",
        "523379810023141376": "Als ich das erste Mal hier durchkam, musste ich eben daran denken. Einfach eine Biosphäre, aber eine echt schöne, mit einzigartigen Slimes und Speisen.",
        "523379810853613568": "Und ... vielleicht stimmt es. Vielleicht wird die Außenwelt nur hier im Labyrinth sicher hinter Glas repräsentiert.",
        "523379811671502848": "Aber ... da bin ich mir nicht mehr so sicher.",
        "523379812455837696": "Was denkst du, ist es wirklich?",
        "523379813261144064": "Ich sollte weitergehen.",
        "523379814079033344": "Das ist es ja, Beatrix. Ich hab keine Ahnung, nicht wirklich. Aber ...",
        "523379814884339712": "Ich bin ziemlich sicher, dass das Labyrinth als Ganzes dazu gedacht ist, den Prismakern einzudämmen und zu stabilisieren. Demnach müsste das Terrarium dann auch mit dem Prismakern zusammenhängen.",
        "523379815681257472": "Und wenn ich mir die Möglichkeiten so anschaue ...",
        "523379816478175232": "Ich frage mich, ob es eine Art Samenbank ist. Wenn in der Zukunft alles den Bach runtergeht und der Prismakern so instabil wird, dass er zusammenbricht ... dann könnte man so sicherstellen, dass ein Teil der Flora die Katastrophe überlebt.",
        "523379817296064512": "Dann wäre das Terrarium eine Art, na ja, Absicherung. Im schlimmsten Fall könnte man noch mal von vorn anfangen.",
        "523379818080399360": "Kann ich verstehen.",
        "523379818885705728": "Wieso kannst du das verstehen?",
        "523379819695206400": "Das versuche ich zu verhindern.",
        "523379820555038720": "Also ...",
        "523379821393899520": "...",
        "523379822186622976": "I-ich meine, was ich in der Vergangenheit getan habe, hilft ja hoffentlich dabei, die Zukunft zu retten. Man will doch alles dafür tun, um eine bessere Zukunft zu bekommen. Auch wenn man nicht genau wissen kann, was wirklich hilft.",
        "523379823033872384": "Aber ...",
        "523379823839178752": "Anders betrachtet: Für alle, die in der Zukunft existieren, ist das hier die Vergangenheit. Wir wollen doch, dass die aus der Zukunft zu uns zurückschauen und das Gefühl haben, wir hätten etwas verändert.",
        "523379824648679424": "Oder noch besser – wir wollen sicherstellen, dass sie sich gar nicht erst sorgen müssen.",
        "523379825487540224": "Was wir hier tun, macht am Ende den Unterschied aus. Das muss ich einfach glauben.",
        "523379826301235200": "Wir können nur den Moment leben. Ich muss weitermachen.",
        "523379827114930176": "Die Lage ist ganz schön übel ... aber hier gibt es auch viel Schönes. Ich hoffe, du kannst es auch genießen.",
        "523380586816630784": "Hi, Beatrix. Faszinierende Gegend, oder?",
        "523380587600965632": "Fast wie eine Art Museum!",
        "523380588435632128": "Keine Zeit zum Ausruhen, Gigi.",
        "523380589240938496": "Die Glaskästen wirken vielleicht so, aber ich glaube, sie haben einen anderen Zweck. Ich denke, sie haben etwas mit der Manipulation von Zeit zu tun.",
        "523380590050439168": "Die mit den Pflanzen hab ich eine Weile beobachtet. In den Kästen läuft die Zeit schneller als außerhalb.",
        "523380590868328448": "Ich denke, dass man so den Effekt des Prismakerns auf die natürliche Umgebung analysieren kann. So könnte man abschätzen, was bei einem Bruch passiert.",
        "523380591715577856": "Ist das auch so bei diesen winzigen Gebäuden?",
        "523380592537661440": "Keine Zeit zum Ausruhen.",
        "523380593342967808": "Vielleicht, aber ich bin nicht sicher.",
        "523380594135691264": "Vielleicht wird dort stattdessen der Raum manipuliert ... Oder es ist sogar irgendeine dritte Sache, die uns so fremd ist, dass wir sie nie verstehen werden.",
        "523380594928414720": "Auf der Regenbogeninsel gibt es so viele Mysterien, Beatrix. Ich glaube nicht, dass wir auch nur die Hälfte zu unseren Lebzeiten lösen werden.",
        "523380595721138176": "Manchmal kann man eben einfach nur durchs Glas schauen und sich fragen, was wohl auf der anderen Seite passiert.",
        "523380596513861632": "Geht es dir oft so?",
        "523380597340139520": "Schon seit sehr langer Zeit, ehrlich gesagt.",
        "523380598174806016": "Mein ganzes Leben war durchgeplant, weißt du: Ich würde erwachsen werden und die Ranch übernehmen, so wie meine Mama sie von meiner Oma übernommen hatte. Eines Tages würde ich sie an mein eigenes Kind weitergeben. Ein wundervolles Zuhause, das Vermächtnis unserer Familie.",
        "523380598980112384": "Für mich war das so eine kleine Welt ... wie diese Kuppeln hier. Als würde ich die Hände gegen das Glas pressen und mir vorstellen, wie das Leben da draußen wäre.",
        "523380599785418752": "Ich bin zur Regenbogeninsel gekommen, um dieses andere Leben zu leben. Aber jetzt bin ich wieder gefangen und diesmal wirklich. Was für eine Ironie, nicht wahr? Ich bin hinter Glas, eingeschlossen wie alles andere hier.",
        "523380600670416896": "Ich versuche, dich so schnell wie möglich zu befreien.",
        "523380601471528960": "Ich weiß, wir müssen uns beeilen, aber genieße ruhig auch das, was du siehst.",
        "523382731968245760": "O nein ... Hier ist Gold. Also ist auch schon das Terrarium betroffen. Immerhin ist es wohl noch eine praktische Abkürzung.",
        "523382733075542016": "Das Gold ist ein Problem, oder?",
        "523382733901819904": "Hier ist eine Abkürzung?",
        "523382734740680704": "Weiter geht’s.",
        "523382735625678848": "Alles in der Nähe des Prismakerns kann von seinen realitätsverändernden Effekten betroffen sein. Stoffe verändern sich, wechseln von fest zu flüssig oder gasförmig oder verschwinden einfach ganz ...",
        "523382736426790912": "Außerhalb des Labyrinths sind die Veränderungen offenbar harmlos, aber hier ist es gefährlicher. Stell dir vor, der Boden unter deinen Füßen verschwindet einfach oder die einzige Ausgangstür wird zu einem massiven Felsen ...",
        "523382737257263104": "Und das Gold ... Es scheint die stärkste Umwandlung zu sein und vielleicht auch das Schicksal dieser Welt, wenn wir nichts unternehmen.",
        "523382738058375168": "Erinnert mich an König Midas aus meinen Büchern.",
        "523382738859487232": "König Midas?",
        "523382739689959424": "Eine alte Legende über einen König, der sich wünschte, alles, was er berührte, würde zu Gold werden. Er wurde unaussprechlich reich, bemerkte aber bald, dass er nichts mehr essen oder trinken konnte, und siechte langsam dahin.",
        "523382740512043008": "Als ich den Prismakern entdeckte, war ich schockiert, weil das ganze Ökosystem sich in Gold verwandelte. Ich rief um Hilfe, aber alle, die herkamen, sahen nur den Wert des Goldes.",
        "523382741329932288": "... Sie wollten diese Kraft nutzen und alles endete in einer Katastrophe. Das lasse ich nicht noch mal zu. Das dürfen wir nicht.",
        "523382742143627264": "Also sollte ich mich beeilen und die Abkürzung nutzen?",
        "523382742982488064": "Ja, ich erinnere mich an eine Abkürzung. Allerdings ist mein Gedächtnis auch nicht mehr so verlässlich.",
        "523382743829737472": "Abkürzungen sind schon witzig. Raum und Zeit sind voller Abkürzungen, wenn man mal darüber nachdenkt. Ich hab meine Erinnerungen an diese Gegend und die Quantentechnologie benutzt, um diese Projektoren aufzustellen. Quasi eine zeitliche Abkürzung.",
        "523382744668598272": "Physische Abkürzungen sind wohl leichter zu erkennen. Wenn man schneller zu einem Ort zurückkehren kann, an dem man schon mal war ... Ein gewaltiger Unterschied, oder? Das kann dein Verhalten komplett ändern. Bei mir auf jeden Fall.",
        "523382745478098944": "Aber am Ende landen wir wohl doch irgendwie immer am selben Ort, so oder so.",
        "523382746308571136": "Bis bald, Beatrix.",
        "523383596829536256": "Beatrix, schau aus dem Fenster. Da draußen ist so viel mehr, als ich dachte.",
        "523383597957804032": "Warst du da noch nie?",
        "523383598784081920": "Warum hast du den Projektor hier aufgestellt?",
        "523383599606165504": "Beeindruckend ... Aber ich sollte weiter.",
        "523383600424054784": "Nein. Ich kann mich nicht erinnern, hinter den Fenstern irgendwas gesehen zu haben. Eben zum ersten Mal, als du den Projektor aktiviert hast.",
        "523383601229361152": "Damals dachte ich wirklich, ich hätte die gesamte Anlage gesehen. Ich war sicher, ich hätte alles erforscht.",
        "523383602017890304": "Aber in Momenten wie diesem sehe ich ganz kurz diese unendliche Weite da draußen. Ein Labyrinth, so weit das Auge reicht. War es die ganze Zeit schon da und ich hab es einfach ... übersehen?",
        "523383602810613760": "Vielleicht aber auch nicht. Vielleicht besteht es aus Quantenarchitektur. Dann könnte es in einem Augenblick da sein und dann wieder weg ... oder auch gleichzeitig da und nicht da.",
        "523383603599142912": "Ich benutze ja oft genug selbst Quantentechnologie. Es wäre dämlich, die Möglichkeit zu ignorieren.",
        "523383604450586624": "Wie nutzt du Quantentechnologie?",
        "523383605264281600": "Ich sollte wohl weitergehen, bevor der Ort hier auch noch verschwindet.",
        "523383606057005056": "Oh, auf verschiedene Arten. Eine davon benutzt du gerade.",
        "523383606879088640": "Die Projektoren selbst sind nicht quantenbasiert, aber die Art, wie ich sie aufgestellt hab. Du hast alle möglichen Tore geöffnet, um hierherzukommen, oder? Ich bin ja nicht da durch, hab alles platziert und dann wieder hinter mir zugeschlossen.",
        "523383607663423488": "Als ich zum ersten Mal hierherkam, war alles offen und unversperrt. Also hab ich mir alles angesehen. Und dann hab ich die Projektoren mittels Quantentechnologie an Orten platziert, an die ich mich erinnert habe.",
        "523383608443564032": "Allerdings ... ist mein Gedächtnis nicht so verlässlich wie früher. Einige Projektoren sind also vielleicht verloren gegangen. Das finden wir wohl raus, wenn du sie aktivieren kannst.",
        "523383609236287488": "Welche Erinnerung hast du benutzt, um den hier zu platzieren?",
        "523383610091925504": "Dann suche ich mal nach dem Rest.",
        "523383610918203392": "Den konnte ich platzieren, weil ich mich an diesen hübschen kleinen Baum erinnert hab. Komisch, da ist plötzlich diese Erinnerung ...",
        "523383611719315456": "Auf unserer Ranch daheim war immer dieser Miez-Slime. Nur ein wilder Slime, der aber ständig vorbeikam und am Nachmittag einfach immer wieder davonhüpfte.",
        "523383612520427520": "Und eines Tages ... bin ich ihm einfach gefolgt.",
        "523383613338316800": "Ich folgte ihm tief in den Wald hinein. Und nach einer Weile kletterte er auf diesen riesigen Baum, wabbelte einfach von Ast zu Ast bis ganz nach oben.",
        "523383614231703552": "Ich bin ihm gefolgt. Zwischendurch hab ich ihn aus den Augen verloren, bin aber einfach weitergeklettert. Und dann hab ich das Blätterdach erreicht und ... Oh, Beatrix, ich kann es gar nicht in Worte fassen.",
        "523383615057981440": "Ich war noch nie so weit oben gewesen und hatte noch nie so viel von der großen, weiten Welt gesehen. Mein ganzes Leben hatte sich auf unserer Ranch abgespielt, und dort sah ich einfach ... alles. Bäume bedeckten die ferne, ferne Weite. Vögel am Himmel ...",
        "523383615863287808": "Es verschlug mir den Atem. Ich blieb stundenlang da oben, bis meine Mama mich suchen kam. Da konnte ich mir ganz schön was anhören ...",
        "523383616693760000": "War nicht das letzte Mal, dass ich einfach verschwand, um die weite Welt zu sehen.",
        "523383617561980928": "Wir werden dafür sorgen, dass du die Welt wiedersehen kannst.",
        "523383618426007552": "Dann solltest du dich wieder auf den Weg machen. Bis dann, Beatrix.",
        "523360220731830272": "Hallo, Beatrix.\r",
        "523361207534120960": "Ich möchte mich noch einmal bei dir bedanken. Dank dir hat diese Welt eine Zukunft. Wir alle.",
        "523368386513235968": "Entschuldige die Aufzeichnung, aber ich muss weiter. Und ich bin echt nicht gut mit Verabschiedungen.",
        "527356088736706560": "Warte, wie ist das möglich?",
        "527357008383995904": "Ich fürchte, ich kann dich immer noch nicht persönlich begrüßen. Ich hätte mich so gerne selbst bei dir bedankt, aber ich hab mich in der Anlage auf der anderen Seite dieses Raums eingeschlossen. Ich will alles erklären. Du hast so viel durchgemacht. Das bin ich dir schuldig.",
        "527357083470426112": "Also von vorn: Mein Name ist ...\r",
        "527357621113090048": "Gigi Twillgers-West.\r",
        "527357752021512192": "Ich bin die Enkeltochter von Hobson und Thora.\r",
        "527359885328412672": "Du glaubst mir vielleicht nicht, aber ... die Kurzfassung ist: Ich komme aus der Zukunft. Zu meiner Zeit hab ich die Regenbogeninsel entdeckt und den Prismakern und ... dann ging alles schief. Alles hat sich so schnell destabilisiert, und als ich es reparieren wollte, hab ich es nur schlimmer gemacht. Ich hab die falschen Leute um Hilfe gebeten, und sie haben versucht, diese Kraft auszunutzen. ",
        "527360055189336064": "Danach brach einfach alles zusammen. Es gab eine Explosion. Prismatisches Licht verbreitete sich über der Regenbogeninsel und erreichte die Atmosphäre der fernen, fernen Weite. Ich konnte mich abschirmen, aber mein Arm ... Irgendwas ist passiert.",
        "527360305023053824": "Die Energie aus dem Prismakern hat sich in mir festgesetzt. Ich kann spüren, wie sie durch meinen Arm fließt, obwohl ich versucht habe, sie aufzuhalten. Deshalb hab ich mich abgeschottet und brauchte deine Hilfe. Wenn ich mich dem Prismakern nähere, wird die Destabilisierung nur beschleunigt, als würde sie auf ihre eigene Energiesignatur reagieren.",
        "527360902036090880": "Aber wenn du hier bist, was ist mit ... deinem Zuhause?",
        "527360988719771648": "Aber wo bist du, Gigi?",
        "527361539041816576": "Meine Welt, die ferne, ferne Weite in meiner Zeit ... Sie steht am Rand des Abgrunds. Die Energie des Prismakerns bedeckt die Atmosphäre und verzerrt alles so wie hier: Bäume werden zu Metall, Wasser zu Glas, und Teile der Welt verschwinden einfach aus der Realität.",
        "527361573745487872": "Bald ist nichts mehr da, um das Ökosystem zu erhalten. Weil ich wusste, dass ich auch daran Schuld hatte ... musste ich einfach etwas tun. ",
        "527363917346402304": "Wie bist du dann ... hierhergereist?\r",
        "527364226567270400": "Erinnerst du dich an deine Reise durch die Glaswüste, als mein Großvater dich zu einem „Portal jenseits von Raum und Zeit“ führte? Als du da ankamst, wirkte es zerstört.",
        "527364268539670528": "Das lag daran, dass ich es bereits benutzt hatte. Ich konnte das Portal in meiner Welt an diesen Punkt unserer Zeitlinie richten. Es gab nur ein Problem ...",
        "527364314953838592": "Durch den Schock der Aktivierung brach es zusammen, als ich ankam. Ich wusste nicht, dass es keine Rückkehr geben würde.\r",
        "527365295787634688": "Du sitzt also hier fest?",
        "527365580824145920": "Ja. Vielleicht gibt es einen Weg, das Portal zu reparieren, aber wie so vieles hier liegt das jenseits meines Verständnisses. Also muss ich akzeptieren, dass ich nie wieder heimkehren kann ... und meine Familie nie wiedersehe.",
        "527365598020792320": "Aber wenn wir den Prismakern irgendwie stabilisieren können, ist es das wert. Dann können wir nicht nur hier und jetzt alles retten, sondern beheben auch meine Fehler in der Zukunft. Daran muss ich einfach glauben.",
        "527366192357863424": "Wie stabilisieren wir den Prismakern?\n",
        "527366405030047744": "Bei meinen Forschungen hier hab ich entdeckt, dass die Person, die das Graue Labyrinth erbaut hat, auch Geräte namens Harmonisierer entwickelt hat, die den Prismakern stabilisieren ... Sie haben nur nicht funktioniert. Es gibt Hinweise, dass es mehrfach versucht wurde und jedes Mal den gegenteiligen Effekt hatte und alles nur verschlimmerte.",
        "527366769041108992": "Aber wenn sie vorher nicht funktioniert haben, warum sollten sie das jetzt tun?",
        "527367021353660416": "Das erkläre ich später. Aber ich habe vielleicht etwas, das die Person vorher nicht hatte ... Etwas, womit es diesmal klappen könnte.",
        "527367034532163584": "Es gibt nur ein Problem: Die Harmonisierer sind verschwunden. Es gibt keine Aufzeichnungen darüber, wo sie sich befinden. Nicht mal darüber, wie sie überhaupt aussehen. Ich tappe da völlig im Dunkeln und weiß nicht, was ich jetzt machen soll.",
        "527649944011173888": "Dank dir kann ich wieder träumen – von einem Leben, das mir gehört. Dank dir kann ich endlich leben, wie ich immer leben sollte. ",
        "527650043873357824": "Aber es gibt noch mehr zu tun. Ich muss das Ökosystem studieren und dafür sorgen, dass es trotz der Schäden weiter gedeihen kann. Aber ich muss auch einfach barfuß im Gras laufen. Die Blumen im Wind riechen. ",
        "527650273687662592": "Ich muss stillstehen und zusehen, wie die Wolken langsam über den Himmel kriechen. Und ich muss einen Freund besuchen und Go spielen bis spät in die Nacht. ",
        "527650329715175424": "Ich muss einfach leben, Beatrix.\r",
        "527650471629451264": "Das Gewächshaus gehört jetzt dir. Ich weiß, da ist es in guten Händen. Wie du dich darum gekümmert hast und um die albernen kleinen Wesen dieser Welt, wie du mir so selbstlos geholfen hast ...",
        "527650601434771456": "Du hast ein wahrlich gutes Herz, Beatrix LeBeau. Und ich bin sehr froh, dich kennengelernt zu haben.",
        "527651735931088896": "Ende der Aufzeichnung.",
        "528371201086222336": "Es funktioniert so: Der Prismakern strahlt permanent chaotische Energiewellen aus, die in unserer Welt offenbar wie Farben aussehen. Das Ganze ist aber mit unserer Welt völlig asynchron, und zwar auf ganz grundlegende, elementare Art. So wird die Realität verzerrt.",
        "528371269646315520": "Und hier kommst du in Spiel. Die Harmonisierer, die du aktiviert hast, senden einen speziellen Energiepuls aus, der durch das ganze Labyrinth strahlt. Zusammen bilden sie eine Art harmonische Energiewelle, und wenn die auf den Prismakern gerichtet wird, versucht sie, ihn zu verändern und ihn auch harmonisch zu machen.",
        "528372202270781440": "Aber du hast gesagt, dass das schon mal versucht wurde und nie geklappt hat?",
        "528372807345270784": "Das stimmt. Aber ich denke, ich hab etwas, das die Erbauer dieses Systems nicht hatten: meinen Arm.\r",
        "528372915524759552": "Ich kann die Energiewellen des Prismakerns in meinem Arm spüren. Ich kann das Chaos spüren ... Deshalb glaube ich, dass ich seine Wellenlänge ändern und diese Harmonie schaffen kann. Weil ich sie selbst spüren kann.",
        "528373981557452800": "Okay, was muss ich tun?",
        "528374290384056320": "Wenn du bereit bist, fange ich an, die Wellenlängen der Harmonisierer auf den Prismakern zu projizieren. Das wird für extreme Störungen sorgen und den Prismakern ins Chaos stürzen, bis wir ihn tatsächlich stabilisieren können.\r\n",
        "528374334084509696": "Dieses Chaos wird die Welt um uns herum massiv beeinflussen und sogar Slimes in schreckliche Terr-Masse verwandeln, die diesen Raum füllt und schließlich alles zerstört, wenn wir nichts dagegen tun.",
        "528374369555738624": "Du musst dich wehren und alle Terrs zerstören, ehe sie den Prismakern destabilisieren und uns alle vernichten. Wasser kann hier normalerweise nicht lange existieren. So nah am Prismakern wird es zu Glas.",
        "528374611244118016": "Aber die Harmonisierer strahlen jetzt durch das Wasser, das hier fließt. Also schnapp es dir und erledige diese Terrs!",
        "528375375807016960": "Und was ist, wenn alles außer Kontrolle gerät?",
        "528377335033524224": "Dafür hab ich vorgesorgt! Ich hab eine Wasserdusche über dem Prismakern eingerichtet. Es muss nur genug Druck aufgebaut werden, damit sie benutzt werden kann. Darum musst du sie mit Slimes füllen. Dann kann sie vielleicht nicht nur uns retten, sondern auch noch ein paar Slimes.\r\n",
        "528378858748669952": "Ich werde dafür auch den Inhalt deiner Vac-Tanks einlagern, damit du genug Platz für die Slimes hast.\r",
        "528378932769746944": "Ich weiß, das ist alles ganz schön viel und auch rein spekulativ, aber es ist unsere einzige Chance.\r",
        "528378958938009600": "Also, bist du bereit?\r",
        "528382405372440576": "Kannst du noch mal den Ablauf erklären?",
        "528383473615532032": "Wenn du bereit bist, probieren wir es noch mal. Ich glaube an dich.\r",
        "528405914672852992": "Ich bin bereit für den nächsten Versuch.",
        "528406570288705536": "Das war’s, Beatrix. Mit den aktiven Harmonisierern und dank deiner Hilfe kann ich versuchen, den Prismakern zu stabilisieren. Bist du bereit?",
        "528419886759309312": "Oh, was hat er gesagt? Niemals aufgeben? Immer weitermachen, auch wenn alles gegen einen steht? Meine Mama sagte immer, mein Großvater war sehr redegewandt.",
        "528420089105117184": "Dein Großvater hat mir mal einen guten Rat gegeben.",
        "528420424708157440": "Er sagte: „Immer schön die Glubscher offenhalten.“",
        "528420990658179072": "Hm? Wie meinst du das?",
        "528421599239106560": "Etwas Verstecktes kann man nur finden, wenn man danach sucht.",
        "528422067466039296": "Aber wo fangen wir an?\r",
        "528422403345903616": "Ich hab hier ein paar seltsame Wände gesehen. Sollte ein guter Anfang sein.",
        "528422630249361408": "Beatrix, das ist es! Ich dachte immer, es gäbe eine Tür oder irgendwas Verschlossenes. Aber was, wenn sie direkt vor unserer Nase versteckt sind? Ich ... Ich denke, ich könnte da etwas basteln, mit dem du diese Theorie überprüfen kannst.",
        "528422765066874880": "Geh zur Tauschstation auf dem Balkon oben. Ich erledige den Rest!\r",
        "528422907241197568": "Bin auf dem Weg!",
        "528428037764182016": "Was passiert jetzt mit dem Prismakern?",
        "528428360129998848": "Das wird die Zeit zeigen, aber ich denke, er kann hierbleiben – als ein weiterer Teil dieser Welt, die wir Zuhause nennen. Bis wir hier aufgeschlagen sind, gehörten Menschen nicht zu dieser Welt, und jetzt schau uns an! Wir wurden ein Teil davon und haben sie dabei nicht zerstört. Genau so sollte es sein.",
        "528428517668057088": "Sogar der Prismakern war einst in der Leere des Raums verloren, ehe er hier gelandet ist, und jetzt ist er auch Teil dieser Welt. Auch er muss seine Bestimmung erst noch finden ... genau wie ich.",
        "528428667819945984": "Dann bist du jetzt frei?",
        "528428859898097664": "Ich spüre eine Veränderung in meinem Arm. Er ist immer noch irgendwie mit dem Prismakern verbunden, aber es ist jetzt anders. Da ist jetzt diese Ruhe, ein leises Summen von Energie. Fühlt sich ... friedlich an.",
        "528428932321144832": "Ich muss noch mehr Tests machen, um ganz sicher zu sein, aber ich denke, ich kann endlich diese Kammer verlassen.\r",
        "528429148046782464": "Wohin wirst du gehen?\r",
        "528429332436774912": "Ich hab noch etwas zu erledigen. Ich muss endlich mit jemandem reden und ihr sagen, dass meine Mama sich so bemüht hat – dass ich mich so bemüht hab, aber einfach nicht die Richtige dafür war. Und dass meine Mama sich jeden Tag so schuldig gefühlt hat, weil sie auch nicht die Richtige dafür war.",
        "528429399419809792": "Wir werden uns wohl eine Weile nicht sehen. Tut mir leid.\r",
        "528429609311170560": "Manchmal führt uns unsere Reise fort von unseren Freunden und jenen, die wir lieben.\r",
        "528431227981164544": "Wie schaffst du das? ",
        "528432241819938816": "Mir hat mal jemand gesagt, dass ich nur zu den Sternen hinaufsehen muss.",
        "528432395541180416": "Zu den Sternen?",
        "528432745895587840": "Egal, wie weit du auch gehst – ihr Licht wird euch beide erreichen.",
        "528433025672441856": "Aber wenn man an einem Ort jenseits aller Entfernungen ist, jenseits der Zeit?\r",
        "528433367000707072": "Ihr Licht war schon vor uns hier und wird es auch nach uns sein.",
        "528433499536519168": "Ich hoffe, dass sie sie sieht. Ich hoffe, sie weiß, dass ich jetzt sicher bin.",
        "528433577198252032": "...",
        "528433676435484672": "Danke, Beatrix. Für alles, was du hier für mich getan hast, und für alles, was du noch tun wirst. Die ferne, ferne Weite ist dank dir ein besserer Ort.",
        "528434010344026112": "Gute Reise, Gigi.",
        "528438915377033216": "Aber egal. Wichtig ist jetzt dieses annullierende Gerät. Also besorge diese Plorts!",
        "528451741088903168": "Übrigens kann ich auch Prisma-Plorts gegen Münzen eintauschen, die du auf so einer Art geheimem Markt ausgeben kannst ... Den hab ich entdeckt, als ich nach spezieller Technologie für den Bau meiner Anlage gesucht hab.\n",
        "528452044051869696": "Ich besorge, was du brauchst."
